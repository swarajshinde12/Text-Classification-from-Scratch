Excuse me.,6,0
Do you have your forms?,6,1
Yeah.,6,2
Let me see them.,6,3
Is there a problem?,6,4
Who told you to get in this line?,5,5
You did.,6,6
You were standing at the beginning and you directed me.,3,7
Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.,6,8
Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.,6,9
This form is a Z.X.four.,6,10
"You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.",6,11
What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.,5,12
No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.,6,13
How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?,5,14
I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.,6,15
I'm here to get an ID.,6,16
"No.  I need another ID, a separate one.",6,17
Like what?  Like a birth certificate?,6,18
"A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?",5,19
Who the hell has a birth certificate?,5,20
"Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?",0,21
"Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.",6,22
That's out of control.,3,23
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.,5,24
How long have you been working here?,6,25
Actually too long.,6,26
"Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?",6,27
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,6,28
That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.,6,29
Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?,5,30
It's not fair.,3,31
Yeah.  I know.,6,32
"I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.",5,33
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...,5,34
"I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.",6,35
"I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice.",6,36
"There's people that have given more though, you know?",6,37
I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.,5,38
I know.,6,39
Then why is that fair?  Why--,5,40
"There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.",6,41
I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.,5,42
"I'm not okay with it, but I don't-- it's not like I have a choice.  I don't see what crying about it is going to fix.",0,43
I'm just trying to think of another way.  I'm just trying to...,6,44
"Just, you know, kicking myself.",3,45
like you sign up because you need money and,6,46
things just aren't what they seem.,6,47
This is a stupid war.,3,48
"We're doing the right thing, though.",6,49
I know.,6,39
I just don't see why it has to be you.,5,50
"If not me then, who?",5,51
What am I going to do? Huh?,5,52
"You'll videotape everything, yeah?",6,53
Yeah.,6,2
"Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?",6,54
Don't you guys have access to computers over there.,3,55
Last month--  Yeah.,6,56
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.,5,57
I have to find sitters.,6,58
I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?,5,59
"We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.",6,60
I know.,6,39
And your mother is close by.,1,61
I'll send you lots of letters.,6,62
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.,6,63
It's just not fair.,3,64
So what's up?  What's new?,5,65
Well Vegas was awesome.,1,66
Yeah.  I heard.,5,67
"And, um, I got married.",1,68
Shut up.  No- in Vegas?,3,69
Yeah.  In the old town part.,6,70
Who did you marry?,6,71
Chuck. [LAUGHTER],6,72
Did you propose to you?,5,73
Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.,1,74
It was at the slot machines.,6,75
Oh.  The Wheel of Fortune slots?,5,76
"Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.",6,77
He turned to you and was like...,5,78
Hey.  Let's get married and I said okay.,1,79
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.,6,80
"Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.",6,81
Yeah.,6,2
But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.,1,82
"Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?",6,83
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.,5,84
Yeah.  Think about that.,6,85
"He's not going to be a citizen, though.",6,86
Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?,6,87
Oh.  Totally.,5,88
"Oh, how are you going to do the long distance thing?  So wait, are you going to move there?",6,89
I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER],6,90
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER],6,91
I have an internet boyfriend.  I guess I'll have to juggle the two.  Is that cheating?  I don't know. Hmm.,6,92
Is that your phone?,5,93
"Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now",6,94
He loves you.,1,95
"He likes to keep tabs, you know.",6,96
How much did he win at the slot?,6,97
"Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.",6,98
Really? Penny slots?,5,99
Penny slots. That's what he plays.,6,100
Wow.,5,101
Yeah.,6,2
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.,5,102
Oh.,6,103
Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-,6,104
"But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.",6,105
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.,5,106
"like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.",6,107
Yeah.,6,2
Well so now we're married. We have cat children.,1,108
Awesome.,1,109
[LAUGHTER] Cat babies.,6,110
"We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.",6,111
That's fair enough.,6,112
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER],6,113
"Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?",6,114
"Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?",5,115
Yeah.,6,2
I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.,5,116
No.  There's regular jobs on there.,6,117
"I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.",6,118
Uh huh.,6,119
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.,6,120
What kind of a job?,5,121
He's like a manager for a theatre.,6,122
Really?,5,123
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.,1,124
He just...,6,125
you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.,5,126
You did?,5,127
Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.,5,128
Yeah.,6,2
He got it?,5,129
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?,6,130
Yeah.,6,2
Hmm.,6,131
What did he do?  What was so great?  I don't understand why they would pick him over me.,5,132
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--,5,133
A resume?,5,134
Yeah.  Do you have a resume?,5,135
No.,6,136
It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,1,137
I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.,6,138
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,6,139
Yeah.,6,2
I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there.,6,140
"No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",6,141
I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.,6,142
"Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.",6,143
Why?  It's a piece of paper.,5,144
"No.  But it has an outline, you know.",6,145
"I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.",4,146
"I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--",6,147
"It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...",6,148
Yeah.,6,2
"Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.",6,149
..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way.,6,150
"Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.",6,151
"That's baloney, that's baloney.",6,152
Please.,6,153
maybe get a car.,6,154
"I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",6,155
you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?,5,156
I didn't say that.,6,157
"You know, you're riding the bus, too.",6,158
"I am riding the bus, but by choice.",4,159
Why?  What choice?,5,160
"To save the environment, carpool.",6,161
You're saving the environment. mmhmm,6,162
Yes.  One less car at a time.,6,163
Interesting.  That's fantastic.,1,164
Mmhmm.,6,165
"You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...",3,166
I'm not frustrated.,3,167
...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.,0,168
Who do you think you are?,5,169
I don't think I'm anyone.,6,170
You are so high and mighty.  I just--,5,171
I- I-I didn't-- okay.,4,172
Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.,1,173
What?  No.,5,174
What? Oh.  So now you're...,5,175
"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",4,176
you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.,3,177
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,6,178
Why not?,6,179
Hi.,6,180
Hi.  Thanks for waiting.,1,181
Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.,6,182
Can I help you?,4,183
Uh huh.,6,119
I need my bag.,6,184
Okay.,6,185
"I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines.",6,186
Okay.,6,185
I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.,5,187
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.,0,188
Nash.,6,189
Okay.,6,185
No G.,6,190
all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?,6,191
Yes.,6,192
Flight seven fourteen.,6,193
Uh-huh.,4,194
"Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?",6,195
"Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--",6,196
"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",6,197
"we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...",0,198
"Oh, Are you kidding me?",5,199
"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",0,200
Is this a joke?,5,201
Yeah.,6,2
"No, no.",6,202
"Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.",5,203
"No, no.  This is real.",6,204
So you'll give me money and then I'll get my bag?,6,205
"No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...",0,206
this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.,6,207
"You're kidding me, this is a joke.",3,208
"Once again, I'm really- I'm really sorry.",0,209
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.,5,210
Yes.,6,192
I know.,6,39
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.,6,211
"I'm very sorry.  But if you see the sign that's right behind me here, it spells it out really clearly that we are not held liable--",0,212
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,3,213
Okay. Calm-,6,214
"Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really",6,215
Do you understand who my husband is?,5,216
"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",6,217
"We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.",6,218
Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?,5,219
It's a gift.,1,220
"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",6,221
You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.,0,222
With the amount of--,6,223
Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?,5,224
"Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?",5,225
Because I probably know him.,6,226
Yeah.,6,2
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--,6,227
"I don't want money, I want my clothes.",3,228
"Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.",0,229
What's your name?,6,230
Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.,5,231
Sean.  Great. Do you have a badge number or something?,5,232
"Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess.",6,233
Okay.  I'll do that.,6,234
Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could.,6,235
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.,5,236
"If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--",3,237
A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.,6,238
"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",6,239
"I'm sorry, Joy.",0,240
It's okay.,6,241
Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?,6,242
"No, no, no.",4,243
...pick up anything?,5,244
No.,6,136
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.,6,245
That's sweet.,1,246
Thank you.,6,247
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,1,248
"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",6,249
Hmm.,6,131
So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,6,250
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,6,251
"this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.",6,252
Oh.  She was there?,5,253
"Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",6,254
"And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.",6,255
Mmhmm.,6,165
"I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.",0,256
Yeah.,6,2
I don't know.,5,257
How long were you there for?,6,258
At the cemetery?,5,259
Mmhmm.,6,165
couple hours.,6,260
"I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.",6,261
Oh really?,5,262
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,5,263
It was hot.[LIPSMACK],6,264
Is it a big cemetery?,5,265
Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.,5,266
"Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?",6,267
Yeah.,6,2
"It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.",6,268
"My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",6,269
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,6,270
Mmhmm.,6,165
Umm. Yeah.,6,271
"And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",4,272
"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",6,273
Mmhmm.,6,165
"Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",6,274
So she wrote a lot of poetry?,6,275
"There's another one, I can't remember.",6,276
"I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?",6,277
Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.,6,278
Did you get the letter?,5,279
"Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know.",6,280
Yeah. That is so awesome.,1,281
Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER],5,282
So I have to move back to the ghetto but...I know.,0,283
"Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.",1,284
"I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.",1,285
"Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?",1,286
"Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.",6,287
"I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.",6,288
This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.,1,289
I know. We should throw a party.,3,290
"At Arapaho we could afford that. [GARBAGE]. Yeah.  So what are you doing this summer, though?  You're staying around, too, yeah?",6,291
A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.,6,292
"I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo.",1,293
It's a relief too. I mean I was thinking I was going to have to pack up all of my stuff but yeah. Hooray for U.S.C.,1,294
Yeah.  Big time.,5,295
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?,4,296
"Umm. It's...It's uhh...It's Critical Studies. It's a really prestigious program, so they say.",6,297
"Oh, okay.",6,298
Ooh. Fancy.,5,299
Yeah.  I'm not sure.,6,300
Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice,5,301
Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER],6,302
"That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?",6,303
"Um, yeah, yeah.  I'm a TA for two sessions. Mmhmm.",6,304
"Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.",6,305
So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.,6,306
You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.,6,307
"I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.",6,308
"Mrs. Nash.  That's so awesome, though.",1,309
"Yeah. Yeah I'm excited. Hooray.  And then I'll be a millionaire once I graduate, you understand? Because that's the way it works.",1,310
Yay...School's fun.,1,311
"Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.",6,312
Yeah.  Totally. [LAUGHTER],6,313
That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.,3,314
"I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.",6,315
What's he going to say?,5,316
Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,6,317
He saw it.,6,318
How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.,5,319
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.,5,322
What was he doing out here at four o clock in the morning?,5,323
I don't know.,5,257
"He's dreaming of him again, walking around.",6,324
I guess he is.,6,325
It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that?,6,326
"I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.",4,327
What?,5,328
"Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off.",6,329
What do you mean dishonest?,3,330
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,5,331
What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,6,332
I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.,6,333
"You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?",4,334
You can't say that to him.,6,335
We've got to say it to him.,6,336
Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?,5,337
"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.",5,338
"To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?",6,339
"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,340
"It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--",6,341
"All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?",6,342
Why?,5,343
You know.,6,344
"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",6,345
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1,346
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",6,347
You know it's not just my business.,6,348
Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,6,349
"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",6,350
Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --,6,351
Then it's not just my business.,6,352
I'm just saying.,6,353
"You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",3,354
Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.,6,355
She's not Larry's girl.,6,356
"From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.",6,357
"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.",6,358
"I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.",4,359
"You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.",6,360
To hell with that.,3,361
I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?,5,362
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,6,364
"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",6,365
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,6,366
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,0,367
So what.  I'm not fast with women.,5,368
Why does it have to be Annie?,5,369
Because it is.,6,370
Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.,6,371
I don't know.,5,257
"You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",6,372
"I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.",4,373
"Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?",5,374
I don't want a diagram.,6,375
He thinks he's coming back Chris.,6,376
"You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...",3,377
...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.,5,378
"All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]",3,379
Just give it some more thought.,6,380
"I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.",6,381
"But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.",6,382
What the hell is this?,3,383
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",6,384
Are you crazy?,3,385
"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.",6,386
You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,3,387
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0,388
Oh.  Must you be inspired?,5,389
"Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.",1,390
"I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.",6,391
You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?,3,392
"On this, I would.",6,393
Well you don't want to think like that.,6,394
Then help me stay here.,6,395
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",3,396
I know that.  Then just help me stay here.,6,397
Just don't think like that.,6,398
Well I am thinking like that.,6,399
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,4,401
I can see that.,6,402
Why did he invite her here?,5,403
Why does that bother you?,3,404
"She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden?",5,405
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,6,406
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,407
"What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?",5,408
[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,3,409
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,5,411
It's got that about it.,6,412
Oh.  So what.,5,413
"What is going on here, Joe?",5,414
Now listen.,6,415
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,6,416
You can't read her mind.,6,417
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",5,418
How do you know why she waited?,5,419
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",0,420
"Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",1,421
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",6,422
What do you want me to do? What do you want?,3,423
"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",6,424
I won't stand for any nonsense.,3,425
Kate.,6,426
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",4,427
[BREATHING],6,428
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",6,430
Okay. Calm yourself.,6,431
"I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?",6,432
"Look at you, you're shaking.",4,433
I can't help it.,0,434
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",3,435
You're the only one who still loves his parents.,6,436
"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",6,437
It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,6,438
"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.",1,439
You're not sorry you came.,0,440
"I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.",0,441
Why not?,6,179
"For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.",6,442
Well.,6,443
"And then, you.  You've been kind of...",6,444
What?,5,328
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,0,445
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.,6,446
I knew they would.,6,447
You did?,5,127
"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",5,448
"So would you want to?  I mean, I guess you have to know that's kind of why I asked you to come?",6,449
"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",6,450
[BREATHING],6,428
"I love you. Annie, I love you.",1,451
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",6,453
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",5,454
No. No,6,455
"You feel uncomfortable here, you feel that it's wrong here somehow.  I just...I don't...I didn't want...I didn't want to take you away from anything.",4,456
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.",6,457
And he's gone forever?  Are you sure?,5,458
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me.,6,461
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Every day since.,6,463
Why didn't you let me know?,3,464
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.  And when you did finally write me,",6,465
Give me a...,6,466
Give me a kiss.,6,467
God.  I kissed you Annie.,5,468
beating around the bush.,6,469
"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",5,470
"Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.",1,471
Not like that you're not.,6,472
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",6,474
"Chris, what is it?",5,475
"Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.",1,476
No. What is it?  Is it your mother?,5,477
No it's nothing like that. It's-,6,478
"Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",6,479
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,6,480
You've got to tell me.,6,481
I don't even know how to start.,6,482
It wouldn't work like this.,6,483
"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?",5,484
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
Well I lost them.,0,486
How many?,5,487
Pretty much all.,6,488
"Aw, geez.",5,489
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,6,490
"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",6,491
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",3,492
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.",6,493
Mmhmm.,6,165
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",6,494
"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",5,495
Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.,5,496
"I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.",6,497
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,6,498
Do you still feel that way?,6,499
I just want you to know Annie.,6,500
"Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me?",6,501
"Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",3,502
"Annie, Annie.  I am going to make a fortune for you.",1,503
What would I do with a fortune?,3,504
"What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh.",5,505
"Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?",5,506
Fine.,3,507
"Okay.  Is that, is that--",6,508
No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.,6,509
[BREATHING],6,428
"I don't know, probably if you can't tell, though, it's probably not them, right?  It's probably going to be like this unmistakable thing, right?",6,510
Oh no.  you know what I forgot?,5,511
What?,5,328
"My flashlight.  God, how could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",5,512
What flashlight?,5,513
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",5,514
That's not your flashlight.,6,515
Whose is it?,5,516
It's ours; it's my flashlight too.,6,517
"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",6,518
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,6,519
No.,6,136
How's that supposed to make me feel?,6,520
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",6,521
"Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.",5,522
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?,5,523
Yeah.,6,2
"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",5,524
"Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?",5,525
"God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.",5,526
[LAUGHTER],6,452
I wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,5,527
I'm cold.,0,528
Do you want my jacket?,6,529
"It's after eleven, let's go.",6,530
What?  We just got here.  What's the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home?,5,531
There is no point.,3,532
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
"Wait, that's my point, too.",6,535
"Well, then let's go.",6,536
"No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",4,537
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I just don't.  It's stupid.,3,539
"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",6,540
"Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.",6,541
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,1,542
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,6,543
I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.,5,544
Yeah they do.,6,545
Oh Augie,5,546
"okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs.",6,547
"There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.",5,548
I'm just not.,6,549
For real?,5,550
Yeah.,6,2
"God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",5,551
"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",6,552
"Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",6,553
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,0,554
Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.,5,555
"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",6,556
"Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.",5,557
"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",1,558
"Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map.",6,559
"Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.",6,560
They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.,6,561
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.,6,562
And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.,6,563
"Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm.",0,564
That's the wind.,6,565
So what do you think?,6,566
About what?,5,567
"About all of that, about all I was talking about.",6,568
"Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.",6,569
That's the wind.,6,565
"Well, so, what do you think?",6,570
About what?,5,567
About what I was saying.,6,571
I think it's ridiculous.,6,572
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,573
It's PR! Somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach.,5,574
"Not just me, look at all of these people.",6,575
"Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more, it keeps us excited.  We keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot, get in on the action.",1,576
"Are we talking about the same thing, here?",6,577
"I'm sorry, it's just fish to me.",6,578
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",6,579
"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",3,580
"Well then, what's bugging you?",3,581
We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.,6,582
"There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.",6,583
"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",0,584
Why not?,6,179
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?,5,585
We've missed them twice.,6,586
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,6,587
They'll show up this time.,6,588
No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus.,6,589
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.,1,590
I thought you wanted to see it.,6,591
You don't understand anything I am saying.,3,592
No. Of course not.,6,593
"I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just...",6,594
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",0,595
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.",6,596
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",6,597
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,6,598
"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",6,599
"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",6,600
Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.,5,601
"We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.",6,602
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,603
"Wait a minute, I got it.",6,604
"Drinking champagne from the bottle,",6,605
"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",6,606
dancing barefoot in the sand.,4,607
"That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?",6,608
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,6,609
Sure.  All right.  Okay.,6,610
"Listen, do you want to dance?",6,611
No.,6,136
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,3,612
No.,6,136
Do you want to take off your shoes?,6,613
"No, no. Nothing.",6,614
Then what?,5,615
Do you want to get married again?,0,616
No.,6,136
What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?,5,617
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?,5,619
I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.,6,620
"Well welcome to the human race, huh?  Do you think I had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish?  No.",6,621
[BREATHING],6,428
"No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?",1,622
Do you know what you get?  You get this.,5,623
This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.,5,624
Yes it is.,6,625
Sure.  This is standing on the beach waiting.  This is fighting.,6,626
Right,6,627
"I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...",6,628
[BREATHING],6,428
Do you understand what I am saying?,5,629
I'm doing the best I can.,6,630
"I know you are Augie, I know.",6,631
"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",0,632
"Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",6,633
I didn't say that.,6,157
I just- I know I don't make you happy.,0,634
"Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",3,635
Yeah?,5,636
Yeah.  Don't you know that?,5,637
For Heaven's sake Augie.,6,638
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",6,639
"You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",6,640
"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",6,641
"I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.",5,642
"We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?",6,643
"Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",5,644
[BREATHING],6,428
And look what I got here.,5,645
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",6,646
It's not champagne.,6,647
I guess we don't need glasses.,6,648
[BREATHING],6,428
Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?,5,649
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.,6,650
"Augie, I'm sorry.",0,651
"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",4,652
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Good God.,5,654
Is it them?,5,655
I wonder.,5,656
Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up.,6,657
It must be them then.,6,658
It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do?,6,659
[BREATHING],6,428
"We are okay, aren't we darling?",3,660
"Now and always, sweet.",6,661
I don't care then.,6,662
It had to happen sooner or later.,6,663
"Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry, what's that?",5,664
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],0,665
[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.,4,666
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER],4,667
We'll behave exquisitely.,6,668
With perfect poise.,6,669
I think I shall do a curtsy.,1,670
"It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?",4,671
Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy.,0,672
"Darling, don't say that.",3,673
It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.,6,674
What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love?,5,675
Yes.  Meaning just that.,6,676
"Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,677
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.,0,678
"Oh darling, you mustn't be serious.  It's just what they want.",6,679
Who's they?,5,680
"All of those futile moralists who make life unbearable.  You have to laugh at them, be flippant.",6,681
"You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness.",6,682
"you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too.",1,683
Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right.,1,684
"How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours?",3,685
Who knows?,6,686
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,3,687
Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,0,688
"Oh dear, should we like that?",5,689
Well it depends on how well we've played.,6,690
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?,6,691
Yes.  Yes with all of his might.,6,692
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",3,693
"No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors.",6,694
I think you are talking nonsense.,6,695
"Oh.  So is everyone, in the long run.",6,696
"Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.",0,697
[LAUGHTER],6,452
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,6,698
"Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.",6,699
"Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",6,700
"Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.",3,701
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,702
Which particular one?,6,703
The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed.,6,704
"Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.",6,705
[GARBAGE],6,706
It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.,4,707
I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that.,0,708
How long did that row last?,6,709
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
Uh huh.,6,119
But the worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,711
"Oh And it burnt my comb, too, and all of those towels in the bathroom.",6,712
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",6,713
[LAUGHTER] That was the first time you hit me.,5,714
I did not hit you very hard.,6,715
"The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,716
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],6,717
[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.,6,718
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,1,719
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,6,720
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,5,721
We were very much younger then.,6,722
And very much sillier.,1,723
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,6,720
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,5,721
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,6,724
"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",6,725
"It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too.",6,726
"It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty.",6,727
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,729
"Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.",6,730
"Well, what of it?",3,731
What of it?,5,732
It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,1,733
What about me?,4,734
"If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",4,735
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",1,736
Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.,0,737
So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?,0,738
No.  Thank you.,1,739
"I'll have a little, I think.",6,740
"I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.",5,741
"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.",6,742
I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.,6,743
"You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.",6,744
It's become a habit with you.,6,745
Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.,6,746
Don't be stupid.,3,747
"Really, Amanda.",5,748
What?,5,328
Nothing.,6,749
"you going out somewhere, dear?",5,750
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,6,751
That reply has broken my heart.,0,752
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,6,753
"Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.",6,754
No it isn't.,6,755
Yes it is.,6,625
You shut up.,3,756
"Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",6,757
It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you.,5,758
"Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.",3,759
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",3,760
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.,3,761
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,3,762
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,6,763
"Yes I did, quite a lot.",6,764
"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.",6,765
Mind your own business.,6,766
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",3,767
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,6,768
You've always had a weak head.,6,769
I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,6,770
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,771
"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",6,772
Oh shut up.,3,773
Shut up.,3,774
"Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",5,775
[LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will.,6,776
"Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.",3,777
Why?,5,343
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,6,778
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,6,779
They are away in Tunis.,6,780
This is no time of year for Tunis.,6,781
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
I will do no such thing.,3,783
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,3,784
"Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.",3,785
"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",3,786
Turn it off.,6,787
"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",4,788
"Amanda, listen, listen.",6,789
Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.,1,790
"Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",3,791
"You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",6,792
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,6,793
You're not going like this.,6,794
Oh.  Yes I am.,5,795
You're not.,6,796
"Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.",3,797
"Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",6,798
Next.,6,799
"Yes, me. Okay, okay here we go.",6,800
My window is open.,5,801
"Okay, so filled out all these forms  --",6,802
This is... Your last- Your first name is Jones?,6,803
and I have This form of ID here so...,6,804
"Yes, Jones.",6,805
That's just strange I figured you filled in wrong sections.,5,806
Well...,6,807
What are you... what's...What are you applying for?,5,808
I'm just applying for another ID.,6,809
Another ID?,5,810
"Yes.  I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this.  It's a long story, I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this other job I really don't get into but I need another...",6,811
Fine.  So I need ID.,6,812
"I have it right here, yes.",6,813
"No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.",6,814
It's really simple if you have a problem with it... Maybe you should--,6,815
But that's...,6,816
"That's why I'm here, that's why I was waiting in this line.  I need to get another form of ID.",6,817
"Well, do you have your passport?",6,818
"No, I don't have a passport.",6,819
You have a birth certificate?,5,820
"I don't where it is though, I don't have with me.  Can I get it from somewhere?  I mean...",6,821
What do you expect me to do?,5,822
I probably have to go wait another line to get my birth certificate don't I?,6,823
Probably.,6,824
You're very helpful.  What's your name?,6,825
Joy.,1,826
"Hi, Joy.",1,827
Hi.   You know...,6,828
So can you help me or not?,6,829
I am..I don't..I don't understand what you want.  A driver's license or a California ID.,5,830
Okay. [BREATHING],3,831
I need California ID.,6,832
Okay.,6,185
On top of these other two forms of ID which I already have.,6,833
"What... well, do you have a driver's license?",5,834
"No, I don't have driver's license.",6,835
Then how am I supposed to give you a California ID?,5,836
Did you even look at the form?  I filled it out all these questions--,5,837
Don't raise your voice with me.,4,838
Did you even look at the form?  I've already answered these question.,5,839
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.,3,840
Okay.,6,185
Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?,6,841
If it makes you stop acting like a child.,3,842
I have been to California my whole--,6,843
"Maybe you never been to the D.M.V. before, maybe you should get back in line.  You know what?  sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one.",6,844
I am not...I'm not getting to back that line.,6,845
"Okay, okay let's keep our voices down, okay?  I didn't come here to get in yelling match.",6,846
I'm perfectly calm.,6,847
"I did not come in here to get in a yelling match with you, all right?",3,848
Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.,6,849
Just try and help me.,3,850
They don't pay me enough to deal people like you.,3,851
"People like me, what is that supposed to mean?  You know, this is ridiculous.  Is there like a manager here, is there someone else that I can talk to?",6,852
Why?,5,343
Why?,5,343
Yeah.,6,2
"So you're not going to send me a thank you card, is that a problem? Is your are not going...",3,853
"Why, because I'm sick of talking to you.",0,854
"'Cause you're obviously not talking to me, you're just yelling at me, berating me and telling me I can't fill out forms right.",3,855
"Oh, dear. Oh, boo-foo-woo, foo-foo.",6,856
"Oh, no honey. And you're going to miss the Christmas card too. It's a shame. It's going to be a good, nice picture.",0,857
Sit back down.,6,858
"Hey, Joy come in here.",1,859
What's happening?,5,860
I have to go back.,0,861
I just got a letter I have to go back.,6,862
When?,5,321
First thing tomorrow morning.,4,863
Are you kidding me?,5,864
How...,6,865
"I don't understand, I don't underst--",6,866
How can they do that?,5,867
They can do it.,6,868
They said you're home for at least four years.,6,869
"I guess they can do it,",6,870
"The National Guard is I guess really spread thin and then everyone has to go.  We all have to go back, my whole companies going back.",6,871
[BREATHING],6,428
That's not fair.,3,872
I can't believe it. I just got back.,5,873
"So yeah, we leave tomorrow...",6,874
[BREATHING],6,428
...we're all shipping out.,6,875
I just got I feel like I'm in shock actually.,5,876
I don't even know what to tell you.,6,877
I don't know.,5,257
What about the birthday party?,6,878
I guess you're just going to have to have it without me.,6,879
"Hey listen, it's going to be okay though, all right?",6,880
You're going to be fine.,6,881
Me?  I'm not worried about me.,4,882
"I'm going to be fine too, okay?",6,883
How do you know?,5,884
I know I have a good... I have a really good group of guys with me.,1,885
We're going to be okay.,6,886
You're going with the same ones?,5,887
Do promise me you're going to take a lot of pictures.,6,888
"Always, I always do.",6,889
I know.,6,39
It's not the same though.,6,890
I just wish there was something I could do.,0,891
We could hide away.,6,892
Run away?,5,893
Mm hmm.  We'll build a bunker and never come out.,4,894
"I really don't want to go, I don't want to go...",0,895
[LAUGHTER] Mmm.,6,896
I'm scared.,4,897
Don't say that.,6,898
I'll send you a letter every single day.,6,899
I love you.,1,900
I love you too.,1,901
The craziest thing just happened to me.,5,902
What?,5,328
This girl; she just offered me fifty thousand dollars to marry her.,3,903
[BREATHING],6,428
Yeah.,6,2
Why?,5,343
"Well, she's not a citizen so she wants to get a visa.",6,904
Is she on the run?,6,905
"No, no, no, no, no, no she just... she's not a citizen but she wants her visa, yeah. She's going to pay me fifty thousand dollars to marry her and stay married to her for two years.",6,906
"Oh, she just needs to marry you.",6,907
That's incredible. That's awesome. Where's she from?  Maybe you can get a dual citizenship.,5,908
That's like twenty five thousand dollar a year for doing nothing. Isn't that awesome?,5,909
"She's actually from England, I think.  Well she- she spoke English but she had an accent. I didn't even ask.",6,910
That's so cool. Uh huh.,1,911
[LAUGHTER] Why did she pick you? Where were you?,5,912
"Fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand dollars. I was just out... I just... she's - well, she's a friend of friend but like...",5,913
You were at a party? And she's like hey. You seem unattached she's like.,6,914
"Yeah.  Can you believe that? Yeah, she's like hey, I'm like sure I'll do it, I don't care. Yeah. I'm like fifty thousand dollars, I'd totally do it for fifty thousand dollars. But the only thing is that's kind of like illegal. So like I could go to jail probably for a long if I get caught, but...",3,915
That's unbelievable... Yeah.,5,916
Well I've known people who have done this before. Yeah.  You just- it's really fun actually 'cause you have like a fake engagement party and all your friends come over and like...,1,917
Have you?,6,918
It's like I'm really going to get married. We'll have like the whole thing.,1,919
"Oh, good. [LAUGHTER]",6,920
"Yeah. Yeah. And then yeah, and then you know like you could like you could do like like sock her for a lot of money",6,921
I know. What do you think I should-,6,922
"Like make her rent the apartment that you two have to live together in, you know. And you won't pay any rent or you pay like, a hundred bucks a month or something.",6,923
Oh good idea.,1,924
Yeah.  Make her like open the bank account and stuff too.,6,925
Yeah.,6,2
It's a good idea.,1,926
"Dude, you lucked out.",1,927
I know.  Also I get to like plan the wedding now too. That will be fun.,1,928
"Yeah.  My colors are blush and beige what is it, do you know?",6,929
"Something blue, something new, something... no I don't know. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, wonder if she's going to pay me up front but do you think it's bad though, do you think they're going to like track the money or something?",5,930
Oh I don't know. [LAUGHTER],5,931
I don't know get it in cash.,5,932
Just cash hardcore.,6,933
Yeah.,6,2
What should we do?  Where should we get married? We should have party.,4,934
How exciting. You should have a wedding on the beach.,1,935
"Yeah, like a big like- A wedding on the beach, that would be nice.",1,936
"Yeah, at night.",4,937
And then we can honeymoon.  I want to go tropical though like Bahamas- --or like Tahiti or something. I just want to like beach and like drink.,1,938
"Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely.",6,939
How exciting.  You should make her bring all your friends too.,1,940

[GARBAGE] She's got to be loaded.  fifty thousand dollars.  That's incredible.,5,942
Incredible.,5,943

"you're a lucky, lucky, lucky man.",1,945
Will you help me plan?,4,946
"Oh, totally. Yeah.",6,947
Good.,6,948
You seem kind of down.,6,949
I'm just mad.,3,950
How come?,5,951
It's--I've been trying to find this job I can't get any job.,0,952
It's not fair.,3,31
What do you mean?,5,953
"I mean I've been looking for a job for like three years and I can't get a job.  I mean like, it's America, right?  I should be able to get a job.",0,954
There's a lot of people looking for jobs.,6,955
"I guess.  But three years?  I mean, I like--I went to college even, I mean I didn't finish but I went for like a little bit.  It's not fair, I don't know.",6,956
"I don't know, I mean, I just don't think...",5,957
"I mean I've been sending out my resumes and doing everything I can do but nothing is happening.  You know, it's like I can't and I can't keep living on loans anymore like this.  I'm going to--I mean eventually I'm going to have to pay it back. I'm just kind of freaking out, I don't know.",3,958
Did you ever think it might be your attitude that's...,5,959
"What's my--like what do you mean ""my attitude""?",6,960
"I don't know just sometimes you get kind of... No, I'm not saying that.  I just--",6,961
Do I have an attitude problem?,6,962
"No, well maybe it's because I'm like frustrated 'cause I can't get a job, you know.",3,963
...has anyone ever just said anything like that to you before?,5,964
"Like it's really hard to like shake that off when you go into like audition a room or whatever, you know what I mean?",4,965
"Right, sure.",6,966
"But I mean you kind of got to, you got to fake it 'til you feel it, right?",6,967
"I guess I just getting really hard to fake, you know.",6,968
I'm just saying that if I was looking to hire somebody in the--or kind of... No. No. No.,6,969
"Are you hiring? Wait, do you know of a job? Seriously, do you know, like do you know of anything though?  Like, oh please, do you know of anything?",3,970
No.  I'm just saying though that if I was a person who was hiring somebody I-- --would not hire someone who was angry or upset.,3,971
Yeah.,6,2
I come across angry?,3,972
No.,6,136
What?,5,328
"Well, you know a little.  If you were to listen to--",6,973
"Okay.  You're my friend you can tell me stuff.  You can tell me honestly stuff, okay?  Please.",6,974
I just don't want you to fly off the handle.,3,975
"Okay, I'm not flying off the handle I don't think I'm flying off the handle here at all.",5,976
You kind of have a short fuse.,6,977
I have a short fuse?,5,978
Yeah.,6,2
"Okay. Okay no, no, no, no okay no, I need to hear this more. Come on, bring it.",3,979
"Like this, right now we're trying have a conversation.",6,980
We're trying to have a conversation and you seem extremely hostile. You keep cutting me off.,3,981
"Well, it's 'cause I can't get a job, okay?",0,982
I'm not always right I'm just--,6,983
I can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in...,6,984
...and you're always right.,6,985
fine okay.,6,986
You have an excuse for everything.,6,987
[BREATHING],6,428
I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.,6,988
I'm like a sponge I'm like soaked up with all this information for like three years I'm just dying for a job to like put it in to.,6,989
[BREATHING],6,428
That's -.,6,990
"You know, and like I don't think it's that much to ask. I know.",6,991
"Well, what kind of field are you looking to go into?",6,992
That's it.,6,993
Can I help you?,4,183
"Yes, please help me.  Where is my bag?",4,994
I need a little more information.,6,995
"Where is my bag?  Come on, I've been here for four hours.",5,996
What- What flight did you come in on?,5,997
"Okay, I'm coming in from Atlanta.",6,998
Georgia?,5,999
"Yes, Georgia.  Good for you I need my bag.  Can you...",6,1000
"There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir.",6,1001
I've been college educated.,6,1002
I speak your language.,6,1003
Are you insinuating that I don't have a college education and that- for some reason that makes you a better person than I am?,5,1004
"Listen, shut your smug mouth, okay?  I don't need that.",3,1005
I'm just saying you don't need to talk to me like I-,6,1006
I've been sitting here for four hours.,6,1007
I'm not a child.,6,1008
I've been here for sixteen.,1,1009
You people have just been tossing me around like a used hanky.,6,1010
I come here every single day.,6,1011
You work here.,6,1012
"Details, Details.  Well, anyhow can I--",6,1013
so you flew in from Atlanta...,6,1014
My bag from Atlanta.,6,1015
Four...Four hours ago.,5,1016
It's a little black bag with wheels.,6,1017
Do you have any i-?,6,1018
That you wouldn't let me put in the overhead compartment.  You said I had to check it.,3,1019
I wouldn't let you?   I was not in Atlanta. I was not in Atlanta.,3,1020
It's a tiny little bag.,6,1021
I had nothing to do with the boarding attendance.  I'm sorry that your seat was wherever it was.,0,1022
"It was right in the middle of five different people.  I had a huge fat lady next me, a crying kid on left I went like can I please get a Bloody Mary, please? Will you bring a Bloody Mary?",5,1023
"I have some unfortunate news, uh, that your bag isn't going to be--",0,1024
#NAME?,6,1025
"Just had a really, really stressful day, okay?  And I need my bag; can you please help me get my bag?",4,1026
I'm really sorry to tell you this but...,0,1027
Okay.,6,185
It's not.  I can offer you fifty dollars and a reimbursement gift cards for our airline...,6,1028
...and your future...,6,1029
"I'm sorry, wait a minute.  Are you saying I'm not going to get my bag at all?",5,1030
No.,6,136
It's gone.,6,1031
Yes.,6,192
Where is it?  Where did it go?,5,1032
We've actually...,6,1033
You mean did someone steal it? Do people steal bags?,3,1034
They do as matter of fact.  We don't like to publicize it because,6,1035
people wouldn't Fly our airline.,3,1036
Probably people that work for your company huh?,6,1037
Do you know what was in that little bag that I could have just easily put in overhead compartment but no I had to check?,5,1038
What was that?,5,1039
My computer which has all of my data which I'm collecting right now.,6,1040
That's unfortunate.,0,1041
Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that.  So I need to have that back.,0,1042
That's too bad.,6,1043
"Fifty dollars is not going to cover me for my job, okay?",3,1044
I wish I could give it to you.,0,1045
Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags?  Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.,6,1046
I wish I-,0,1047
That's not - no.,6,1048
No.,6,136
It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.,6,1049
We have plenty of aggressive searching going on it's not there.  Someone's taken it.,6,1050
"Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.",6,1051
I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.,6,1052
You know I don't need to take this sort of abuse.,6,1053
"Well, I don't need to take this kind of abuse either.  I just was trying get back to Atlanta. I just got home, I just want to get my bag and get my stuff. And keep my job.",6,1054
That's fantastic.,1,1055
Then why don't you take your fifty dollars. Get yourself a taxi and go shopping tomorrow.,3,1056
[BREATHING],6,428
Thank you very much.,1,1057
You okay?,3,1058
"Yeah, I'm just-- yeah",6,1059
"Just kind of feel numb, you know.",0,1060
What's happened?,5,1061
You didn't even hear?,5,1062
[BREATHING] Umm.,6,1063
God I've told this story so many times. Umm.,6,1064
You don't have to if you don't want to.,6,1065
I just...I just basically lost someone that was really close to me.,0,1066
"And I've kind of been dealing with all of the...the stuff, you know the hospital and people work because...",6,1067
I'm sorry to hear that.,0,1068
"He kind of didn't have anyone to take care of that for him, so--",6,1069
You've been taking care of it all?,6,1070
Oh Jesus.,5,1071
It's just really...really messed up.,6,1072
He sick for awhile?,6,1073
No.,6,136
Just like it.,6,1074
Was it an accident?,6,1075
"No, I mean it just came on really quick, you know I mean it was a [GARBAGE] it was a sickness but it just --",5,1076
how was sick?,6,1077
What?,5,328
"Well, I'm confused.  He was sick or it was an accident?",6,1078
"He was sick. He got sick. He got sick but it happened really, really fast, you know.",5,1079
Oh. Really fast? Oh.,5,1080
It was kind of like boom... done,5,1081
Yeah.,6,2
It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...,6,1082
Yeah.,6,2
#NAME?,6,1025
"Totally, yeah.",6,1083
So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.,6,1084
Mmhmm.,6,165
Lock,6,1085
Mmhmm.,6,165
The plans you make [GARBAGE].,6,1086
"Exactly, you know, and like he had so many plans and he was going to do...",6,1087
It leaves a hole for you too.,6,1088
"so many things, you know?",5,1089
"It leaves a hole for you too, in your plans together.",6,1090
What?,5,328
Yeah.,6,2
It gets better.,6,1091
"He was a really, really good guy.",1,1092
Mmhmm.,6,165
A lot of people loved him.,1,1093
MMhmm.,5,1094
"You know, it's like affecting a lot of people it's not just me, you know?",6,1095
Mmhmm.,6,165
How long did you know each other?,6,1096
Umm...,6,1097
For like eight years.,6,1098
That's a long time.,6,1099
Yeah.,6,2
It's good that you were there.,1,1100
"Yeah, I'm glad I was there. Glad I- glad I got to be there.",1,1101
"So weird,",6,1102
Yeah.,6,2
"like I can't...it's like you know it's like ""pinch me"" it's like I can't believe like I'm dealing with this, you know.",5,1103
Are there things you wish you'd done differently?,5,1104
Check this out.  You know how I've told you I've been really into like softball recently?,6,1105
Yeah.,6,2
"Well, this is totally random, I got this full ride scholarship to go to U.S.C next year to play softball.",6,1106
[LAUGHTER]. For softball? That's unbelievable. Is it slow pitch?,5,1107
For softball.  They're going to pay me to go to school. Isn't that awesome?,5,1108
"Yeah.  Well, I don't--well yeah I can pitch, I'm not like the pitcher though. I'm like the pinch hitter guy I mostly just hit.  But I guess I'm going to have to... Yeah, and then I play shortstop too but... It's so ex- The good news is I get to stay here.",1,1109
Uh huh.,6,119
Pinch hitting softball.,6,1110
That is incredible.,5,1111
That's amazing. They pay for everything?,5,1112
"I know. For softball, yeah.",6,1113
"Your housing, books, everything? That is incredible.",5,1114
"Yeah, everything. Every like- free ride and I get to, you know, like be on like a Trojans sports team too. And it's like cool. Isn't it awesome?",1,1115
That is incredible. Do you get like a per diem?,5,1116
"I don't know. I should ask. Yeah, I will.",6,1117
You should...You should look into that.,6,1118
"That is amazing, congratulations. Good for you.",5,1119
Thank you.,6,247
But I don't know I want to live in the housing that they give me though 'cause I think I want to you know like get like a nicer place.,6,1120
Oh.,6,103
"Yeah, that you probably. You should see one of these Victorian houses around by.",6,1121
Where should I move?,4,1122
"That's a really good idea. Or I could go to like Santa Monica. Go beach. Venice beach, yeah a little dirty though. I don't want to go to Venice beach. But - Malibu. All right.",6,1123
Oh. Venice beach.,5,1124
"Oh, you don't like that. You're west-sider?",6,1125
"Okay. That would be way too much of a commute you can't do that. Especially- I know especially from--I don't know, what I was going to say, I don't know.",6,1126
Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER],6,1127
From where? Huh? Well I'm from San Francisco.,5,1128
I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.,6,1129
"Oh yeah, that would be.  Well, depends on what type of car you had, though too. I guess it would be worth it. helicopter. Yeah, helicopter.  There is a helipad there, right? Yeah, exactly.",6,1130
Oh yeah. He'd drop you right off at practice?,5,1131
Do you--are you one of those like four a clock in the morning practices?  Is it--that's more like swimming and- --ballet and things like that.,6,1132
Yeah. I think it's in the afternoon 'cause I mean can't be too early 'cause then you can't see the ball.,6,1133
They have those neon--softballs.  They're like day-glow you can see them anywhere.,6,1134
"Yeah, but no. Well, they have a night games but you know there's more like night games they're not like morning games, you know. I guess it's kind of same thing.",6,1135
I'm surprised you don't know that.,5,1136
Oh. That is incredible. Is it--,5,1137
"do they have a--is it a co-ed softball team?  I mean... Really? You know, I didn't even know that they have that.",5,1138
No it's all boys. All boys' softball team.,6,1139
They do it's--believe me it's huge.,5,1140
Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?,6,1141
I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...,6,1142
That is unbelievable.,5,1143
It's pretty wild.,6,1144
I would put that right up there with--ping-pong.,6,1145
"Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE]",6,1146
I mean not to denigrate what you are doing.  I think that's great.,6,1147
Oh you mean it's not really sport that what you're saying?,5,1148
"No, no.  I love softball. I played softball all the time.",1,1149
It's totally a sport. What are you talking about?,5,1150
"What, just 'cause I don't play regular baseball doesn't mean I'm like any less of like a sports guy.",6,1151
I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.,1,1152
For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time?,6,1153
But they got to like drive around in a bus--that would suck.,6,1154
Oh really? With the whole team?,5,1155
Yeah we have like away games and stuff.,6,1156
What are your teammates like? I'm sure you don't know yet? What kind of people play softball?,6,1157
They're nice.,1,1158
"Like, you know like police officers, like--kind of heavyset guys. Mustaches, yeah. It's that kind of-",6,1159
Oh really?,5,262
Cool. You don't seem like you'd fit in there.,6,1160
That kind of...They're okay.  No I'm like- I'm kind of like the odd man out I'm like...,6,1161
"Oh, cool.",1,1162
But you know I'm like [GARBAGE].,6,1163
You're like the rookie? The new kid.,6,1164
Yeah.,6,2
Just watch in five years you'll be like on the force. You carry around donuts in your back pocket... [LAUGHTER],6,1165
I'm going to have a mustache...On the force...,6,1166
Pull over..,6,1167
What he's going to say?,5,1168
He saw it.,6,318
When?,5,321
He was out here at four this morning.,6,1169
How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed.,5,1170
I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.,4,1171
What was he doing here at four in the morning?,5,1172
I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.,6,1173
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.,6,1175
Cried hard?,6,1176
"Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.",6,1177
[BREATHING],6,428
What is he doing out here at that hour?,5,1178
I don't know.,5,257
"He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.",6,1179
I guess he is.,6,325
It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,6,1180
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.,4,1181
What?,5,328
"I mean, these kinds of things, man they always come back at you.  And this is definitely coming back to us.",6,1182
What do you mean a mistake?,5,1183
"I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?",3,1184
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",3,1185
"I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.",6,1186
You can't say that to him.,6,335
I got to.,6,1187
"What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?",5,1188
"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.",5,1189
"To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?",6,1190
"Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",6,1191
The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--,3,1192
"Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?",6,1193
Why?,5,343
You know.,6,344
"Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?",6,1194
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1,346
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",6,1195
You know it's not just my business.,6,348
"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.",6,1196
So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?,6,1197
You want to make sure that your father's not going to...,6,1198
"See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?",3,1199
I'm just saying.,6,353
I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,0,1200
She is not Larry's girl.,6,1201
"From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",6,1202
I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...,4,1203
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,6,1204
To hell with that.,3,361
Did you ask Annie yet?,5,1205
"No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.",6,1206
"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.",6,1207
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",6,1208
"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",6,1209
So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.,5,1210
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,1211
Because it is.,6,370
"That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",6,1212
"I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.",6,1213
"He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",6,1214
"Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.",4,1215
All right then.,6,1216
Give it some more thought.,6,1217
I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.,6,1218
"When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.",6,1219
What the hell is this?,3,383
I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.,0,1220
Are you crazy?,3,385
I'll do it.,6,1221
You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?,3,1222
Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0,1223
"Oh, must you be inspired.",6,1224
"Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.",1,1225
If that can't happen here...,6,1226
You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.,3,1227
"Yes, on this I would.",6,1228
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",6,1229
Then help me stay here mom.,6,1230
"All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.",3,1231
"I know, I know.",6,1232
Then help me stay.,6,1233
"Well, you don't think like that.",6,1234
I am thinking like that.,6,1235
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",4,1236
"Well, I can see that.",6,1237
Why did he invite her here?,5,403
"Well, maybe he wanted see her.",6,1238
It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?,5,1239
"Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?",3,1240
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.,3,1241
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,5,411
it's got that about it.,6,1242
Oh so what?,5,1243
"What is going on here, Joe?",5,414
"Okay, now listen, kids...",3,1244
The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,6,1245
Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.,3,1246
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited.,5,1247
And how do you know why she's waited.,5,1248
Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. in my darkest moments I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.,0,1249
"Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?",1,1250
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.",3,1251
What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,4,1252
"I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",3,1253
Kate...,6,1254
Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.,4,1255
[BREATHING],6,428
"Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.",6,1256
"All right, calm yourself.",6,1257
"Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.",5,1258
"Okay, calm yourself. Alright.",6,1259
calm yourself.,6,1260
You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.,6,1261
What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?,5,1262
Look at you. You're shaking.,4,1263
I can't help it.,0,434
"What the hell do you want from me, Kate?",3,1264
The only one I know still love his parents.,0,1265
"Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?",6,1266
Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.,6,1267
"You know it's nice here, the air is sweet.",1,1268
You're not sorry you came?,5,1269
"Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.",0,1270
Why not?,6,179
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.,6,1271
Well.,6,443
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...,6,1272
What?,5,328
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,6,1273
"I was kind of planning on sneaking up on you, you know over like a course of a week or so. They just take for granted that we're already set.",6,1274
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",6,1275
You did?,5,127
From her point of view why else would I come?,5,1276
Yeah--,6,1277
"So then would you want to?  I mean I guess, you kind of have to know, maybe that's why I asked you to come.",6,1278
Well I guess that's why I came.,6,1279
"Ann, I love you.  I love you.",1,1280
I love you a great deal.,1,1281
I'm sorry I don't really have much of an imagination.,0,1282
"Chris,",6,1283
"I'm sorry I'm embarrassing you, aren't I?  See, I didn't want to do it here I didn't on this porch, with this ring--I didn't want to win you away from anything.",5,1284
"I've been ready a long, long time.",6,1285
So then he's gone.  You sure?,5,1286
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me.,6,461
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Everyday since.,6,1287
why didn't you let me know?,3,1288
"Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.",6,1289
"Oh Annie, why don't you go ahead and give me a kiss, come on just a...",3,1290
I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.,1,1291
I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.,5,1292
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do what like you, Chris.",6,1293
"Chris, what's the matter?",5,1294
Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.,6,1295
"No, what is it?  Is your mother?",5,1296
"No, no, it's nothing like that.",6,1297
"Well, then what?  You know, even in your letter you seem kind of ashamed.",6,1298
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,6,1299
You got to tell me.,6,1300
I don't know.,5,257
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,6,1301
Wouldn't work like this.,3,1302
you know over seas I was in command of the company?,6,1303
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
Well I lost them.,0,486
How many?,5,487
Pretty much all.,6,488
[BREATHING]. Geez.,6,1304
"Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.",6,1305
"For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",6,1306
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.,6,1307
"They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",3,1308
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...",6,1309
"You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",6,1310
"I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",5,1311
You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,4,1312
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,6,1313
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.,0,1314
'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,6,1315
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.,6,1316
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.,0,1317
Do you still feel that way?,6,499
I want you to know Annie.,6,1318
"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you have a right to...",6,1319
Everything Chris do you understand that?  To me too...,5,1320
And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air.  You should be proud of that a man should be paid for that.,6,1321
Annie...,6,1322
I'm going to make a fortune for you.,1,1323
What would I do with a fortune?,3,504
"What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.",5,1324
"Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good.",6,1325
I'm fine.,6,1326
"Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--",5,1327
"No, I think that's just foam.",6,1328
Ugh...,6,1329
"Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?",6,1330
"Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?",5,1331
My flashlight.  How could I forget my flashlight?  God--,5,1332
What flashlight?,5,513
Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?,5,1333
That's not your flashlight.,6,515
Whose is it?,5,516
"It's ours; it's my flashlight, too.",6,1334
"Oh, well, yeah of course.",6,1335
"You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?",6,1336
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.",6,1337
"Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.",5,1338
"It's a nice moon though, should stay full.  Do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember was it full last year?",1,1339
Yeah.,6,2
Are you all right?  Are you okay?  You cold?  Do you want to my jacket? My jacket? No?,5,1340
No.,6,136
"You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.",6,1341
What's wrong?  Are you okay?  Huh?  You cold?,5,1342
I'm fine.,6,1326
"Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.",1,1343
I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.,5,1344
I wonder if they can hear me talk,5,1345
"I wonder if they can hear me talking, you know.",5,1346
Like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,6,1347
I'm cold.,0,528
Do you want my jacket?,6,529
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",6,1348
What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?,5,1349
There is no point.,3,532
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
That's my point too.,6,1350
Then let's go.,6,1351
"No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.",6,1352
Don't you want to see it?,3,1353
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
"I just don't, it's stupid.",3,1354
It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.,6,1355
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,6,1356
"Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",6,1357
Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy.,6,1358
"I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.",5,1359
"Yeah, they do.",6,1360
"Oh, Augie.",6,1361
"Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.",6,1362
"It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.",5,1363
I'm not.,6,1364
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
All right.,6,1365
"I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...",5,1366
And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.,5,1367
"Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",6,1368
We just weren't in a good spot though.,6,1369
We didn't see them the year before either.,6,1370
We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.,6,1371
"Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...",4,1372
"Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...",6,1373
"They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...",5,1374
They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...,6,1375
Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...,6,1376
"And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...",6,1377
It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.,6,1378
"It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.",6,1379
That's the wind.,6,565
They're out there swimming right now...,6,1380
...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...,1,1381
"Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.",3,1382
That's the wind.,6,565
"Well, so?  What do you think?",5,1383
About what?,5,567
About what I was saying.,6,571
I think it's ridiculous.,6,572
It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,1384
It's a PR.,6,1385
Somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach.,5,1386
"It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people.",6,1387
They're all told the same thing.,6,1388
"Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.",6,1389
"Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.",6,1390
Their life will start then.,6,1391
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
I'm sorry it still just fish to me.,0,1393
Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?,6,1394
"Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",3,1395
"Okay, well then what's bugging you?",3,1396
"I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",6,1397
"Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.",6,1398
"Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.",0,1399
And then we go home and they go home.,6,1400
Why not?,6,179
"Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?",5,1401
We missed them twice.,0,1402
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.,6,1403
"Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.",6,1404
No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.,6,1405
"I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.",1,1406
"Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards",6,1407
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,3,1408
and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.,6,1409
Of course not.,6,1410
"I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.",6,1411
"Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.",6,1412
"you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.",6,1413
"Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go.""",6,1414
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--,6,1415
Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.,6,1416
We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.,5,1417
"While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them.",6,1418
"And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,1419
"Wait a minute, I've got it.",6,1420
"Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.",4,1421
"It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?",6,1422
"You want this to be like the other times, right?",6,1423
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,6,609
"Oh right sure, of course.",6,1424
Do you want to dance?,6,1425
No.,6,136
You want me to go get some champagne?,3,1426
No.,6,136
Do you want to take off our shoes?,6,1427
No.,6,136
What? Huh?,5,1428
You want to get married again?,5,1429
What?  What?  You want to divorce?,5,1430
No.,6,136
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
"A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?",5,1431
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,6,1432
"Well, welcome to the human race.",6,1433
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.,5,1434
"You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think ""Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska.""",5,1435
"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",6,1436
No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.,6,1437
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,1438
"Yeah, it is.",6,1439
"Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.",6,1440
Right.,6,533
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,6,1441
I know me neither.,6,1442
This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,5,1443
I'm doing the best I can.,6,630
"I know that Augie, I really do.",1,1444
"I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",0,1445
Maybe if you were with somebody else too?,6,1446
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.",0,1447
Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.,5,1448
Yeah?,5,636
"Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?",3,1449
"You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",6,1450
"Actually, you know what?  Now you mentioned that--no I don't.",5,1451
So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.,6,1452
"I don't know, just seemed like such a good spot to me.",6,1453
We do have really good view of the moon from here though.,6,1454
Oh I saw that.  Pretty isn't it. Big ol' white moon.,5,1455
Look what we got here.,5,1456
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",6,1457
It's not champagne.,6,647
I guess we don't need glasses.,6,648
"Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?",0,1458
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.,6,1459
"Augie, I'm sorry.",0,651
Shh...,6,1460
"If we are really quiet, the fish might come.",4,1461
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Good God.,5,654
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up.,6,1463
Must be them then.,6,1464
What we're going to do?,5,1465
"We're okay, right darling?  Whatever happens, we're okay?",6,1466
Now and always sweet.,6,1467
I don't care then.,6,662
It had to happen sooner or later.,6,663
Yes... Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry what's that?,5,1468
"No, it's a wrong number.",6,1469
"Oh, oh, that sent shivers on my spine.",4,1470
[BREATHING] [LAUGHTER],6,1471
Oh...,6,1472
[BREATHING],6,428
[BREATHING],6,428
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,4,1473
Oh. Behave exquisitely...,6,1474
With perfect poise...,6,1475
[LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.,6,1476
Ah...,6,1477
[LAUGHTER],6,452
Ah...Strange...,5,1478
Mmm...,6,1479
"Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?",4,1480
The pity is that one can't stay happy.,0,1481
"Darling, don't say that.",3,673
It's true.  I think the whole things a very poor joke.,6,1482
"What, this sacred and beautiful thing, love?",5,1483
"Oh, yes meaning just that.",6,1484
"Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?",5,1485
[LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.,0,1486
"You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want.",3,1487
Oh whose they?,5,1488
"Oh you know all those superficial philosophers. We must laugh at them, be flippant.",6,1489
Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.,6,1490
"Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",6,1491
Oh yes.  .,6,1492
"How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",6,1493
We are figures of fun all right,1,1494
Ahh...who knows.,5,1495
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,3,687
"No, that will fade...Along with our passion...",0,1496
"Oh, will we like that?",6,1497
Well it depends on how well we've played.,6,690
If one of us dies...,0,1498
does the one that's left still laugh?,5,1499
"Yes, yes with the all his might.",6,1500
"Well, that's serious enough isn't it?",0,1501
"No, no, no, no death is very laughable it's a cunning little mystery, you know.  It's all done with mirrors.",6,1502
I think you're talking nonsense.,6,1503
"Ah so is everyone in the long run, huh?",6,1504
Hmm.,6,131
"Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]",0,1505
Ah.,6,1506
"Come here darling, kiss me",6,1507
"Oh, Elliot.  Worms don't pop.",6,1508
before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,6,1509
"See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome.",6,1510
"Oh, thank you darling.",1,1511
You could run off with all the men in a world. I won't say a word.  Just as long as you love me best.,6,1512
"The same applies to you too, except you so much as look at another women I'll kill you.",3,1513
Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?,6,1514
Which particular one?,6,703
The one when you put that little wooden painted snake in my bed?,6,1515
"Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.",6,1516
It was a horrible thing I hated it.,6,1517
"Oh I know you threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  Oh, I'll never forgive you for that.",0,1518
Of course how long did that row last?,6,1519
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,6,1520
Cannes...mmhmm...,6,1521
Oh it burnt my comb too and all those towels in the bathroom.,0,1522
Oh that was a rouser wasn't it?,6,1523
The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER],6,1524
I will never forget the look on his face.,6,1525
Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...,6,1526
oh...,6,1527
"Utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,1528
oh...[LAUGHTER],5,1529
We were very much younger then.,6,722
Very much sillier.,1,1530
"However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,1531
Oh you knew there was nothing in that.,5,1532
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"[LAUGHTER] Utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,1533
We were very much younger then.,6,722
Very much sillier.,1,1530
Mmhmm.,6,165
"However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,1531
Oh you knew there was nothing in that.,5,1532
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,6,1534
Presents? It was a trivial little broach.,6,1535
It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,6,1536
Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.,6,1537
You sent out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,6,1538
I did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,1539
"Well, you let him kiss you.  You said you did.",6,1540
"Well, what of it?",3,731
What of it?,5,732
"It gave him a lot, a great deal of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.",1,1541
And what about me?,6,1542
If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd never known a thing about it.,4,1543
That's a nice point of view I must say.,1,1544
I'm bored with this conversation.,0,1545
So am I.  I'm bored stiff.  You want some brandy?,0,1546
"No, thank you.",6,1547
"I'll have a little, I think.",6,740
I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.,5,1548
"Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.",6,1549
I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.,6,1550
You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.,6,1551
"I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you.",6,1552
"Hmm.  Well, you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment, okay?",6,1553
Do be quiet.,6,1554
"Really, Amanda.",5,748
"Don't be stupid, what?",3,1555
Nothing.,6,749
Are you going out somewhere dear?,5,1556
"No, darling I'm just making myself fascinating for you.",6,1557
That reply has broken my heart.,0,752
Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?,6,1558
As matter the fact that's perfectly true.,6,1559
"Oh no, it isn't.",5,1560
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"Don't be stupid, shut up.",3,1562
"You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.",6,1563
"Oh, well that's funny.  It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",1,1564
"You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.",3,1565
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",3,760
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.,3,1566
They sting.,3,1567
"I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.",3,1568
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,6,763
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",6,1569
I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.,6,1570
"Oh, mind you own business.",6,1571
"I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",1,1572
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.",3,1573
I am not in the least bit drunk.,6,1574
You always had a weak head.,6,1575
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,6,1576
"On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,1577
"Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.",6,1578
Shut up.,3,774
Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?,5,1579
That's a very good idea I think I will.,1,1580
Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.,3,1581
Why?,5,343
There are no people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,6,1582
Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.,6,1583
They are away in Tunis.,6,780
This is no time a year for Tunis.,6,1584
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
I will do no such thing.,3,783
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,6,1585
Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,3,1586
I won't.,6,1587
Turn it off.,6,787
Stop it. No. Go away.,3,1588
Amanda listen. Listen.,6,1589
"listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.",4,1590
That's very amusing indeed.,1,1591
"Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible.",3,1592
"You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.",6,1593
This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,6,1594
You're not going like this.,6,794
"Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.",3,1595
No you're not.,6,1596
Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.,3,1597
"Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration.",6,1598
Hi.,6,180
"Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate.",6,1599
My--my original birth certificate?  But I don't carry that with me.,6,1600
Right.  Well.  We still need it.,6,1601
"Well, I have my driver's license, does that work?",6,1602
"No. no  Uh, no one told you that you needed your original birth certificate.",0,1603
No it doesn't say it on the form.,6,1604
"I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification.",6,1605
I mean if I had known--I would have brought it.,6,1606
um Sorry.,0,1607
"Okay.  Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you.  You're gonna have to go back and uh...",0,1608
"Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is.",6,1609
It's lunch hour.,6,1610
Right.  It's the D.M.V..,6,1611
"I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?",6,1612
"Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.",3,1613
I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.,6,1614
"Alright, I don't know what to tell you right.",6,1615
"I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can-",6,1616
"But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me.",6,1617
I can't.,0,1618
And I can give you my social--,6,1619
"I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone.  I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to-",0,1620
"Well, I can give you my Social Security Number.",6,1621
"No, it's--",6,1622
And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day.,6,1623
"Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need--",4,1624
I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes.,0,1625
"Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--",6,1626
"Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me.",0,1627
I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry.,0,1628
Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I-,4,1629
The line--,6,1630
"I really need this done today.  As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back.",0,1631
"Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting",6,1632
"Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?",6,1633
"I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--",6,1634
"You know, Official documentation--",6,1635
"Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.",6,1636
"No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--",4,1637
With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.,6,1638
"But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?",6,1639
"Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.",6,1640
"All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.",0,1641
"So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.",6,1642
Do you have a supervisor?,6,1643
I am the supervisor.  So--,6,1644
"Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful.",1,1645
It's almost time for me to go.,6,1646
I can't believe that--now--are you sure this is absolutely necessary?  Like--,5,1647
"There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know--",6,1648
What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I--,4,1649
"You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can.",6,1650
"But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow.",6,1651
I don't think so.,6,1652
"Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or--",4,1653
"Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile.",6,1654
You could send me pictures.,6,1655
It's not going to be the same.,6,1656
"What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because--",4,1657
"Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all--",0,1658
"and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.",4,1659
This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you.,6,1660
"I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and--",6,1661
But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that--,6,1662
You can just remember it for me.,6,1663
I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was--,5,1664
"Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it.",6,1665
"I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know",6,1666
"I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but--",6,1667
...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together.,6,1668
I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger.,4,1669
I don't want you in danger.  Where are you going?  You're going over to war.,4,1670
I have no choice. There's nothing I can do.,0,1671
All right.,6,1365
"Oh my God.  Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what?",5,1672
What?,5,328
"Well, guess.  Guess, guess, guess, guess.",6,1673
"Um, you--",6,1674
Don't look at my left hand.,4,1675
No.  Let me see.,6,1676
"Oh, no way.",6,1677
"He proposed.  He proposed.  Well, and I said yes, of course. [LAUGHTER]",6,1678
That is great.  You look radiant.  I should've guess.,1,1679
I'm so excited.,1,1680
"Well, Tell me about him.  What happened.",5,1681
"Remember how we had that date?  And I was like, oh yeah, this is a date, whatever.",6,1682
"So after we sort of went out dinner and I was already like tired.  I wasn't all that excited and and so he's like let's go down to the beach and I was like no I don't want to the beach, like I'm tired. And he's like no, no we have to go.  And I was like okay, like that's a little weird.",6,1683
"So, he--so we walked down to the pier and there's like these lights--like these little, like lights-- and we're like what's that? And he's like I don't know let's go find out.",6,1684
So we walked down there and there's-[LAUGHTER]-And there's- this huge like ten foot heart in candles on the beach--,5,1685
What?,5,328
"like all they have And I was like, what's going on?  And he like takes my hand and pulls me into the middle and he's like--you know, get's on his knee and everything--And says will you marry me? And I flipped out.",5,1686
That--that is the most romantic thing I have ever heard.,5,1687
"I know.  I was like, how did he get--like he must have called someone or had them set--like, I have no idea.",5,1688
"Wow.  Yeah, 'cause yeah I don't know I'm sure if he--oh yeah he definitely had--would have had to have someone else--",5,1689
'Cause- 'Cause he was with me. You didn't do it did you?,3,1690
"Yeah.  I mean candles wouldn't stay--No, I didn't--I didn't know anything about it.",5,1691
You didn't know anything?,5,1692
No. I'm just as happy as you are.  This is--,1,1693
"I was just--it was so like I thought this might happen eventually, but like not yet, you know what I mean?  Like--",6,1694
"So, I mean--it's good though.",1,1695
"It is good.  It's totally good.  I mean, it like oh, you know.",1,1696
"Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I'm shaking.  I can't even--",4,1697
I know. So we're gonna take it--Like we're not gonna get married right away--'Cause we want to like have plenty of time to plan everything out,6,1698
"...and, um, my parents want to like be part of it and help out and everything--So we want to give it lots of time to like--",6,1699
"Oh. Do they--do they know yet? Have you told them? Oh, that's--",5,1700
"Yeah, yeah, I called them. I called them And, of course, they were so excited 'cause they love him. Like they always have.  Um--",1,1701
That's great.  Yeah.,1,1702
"So, yeah, I mean, it'll be good.  We wanna like, uh, I think we're gonna have it in spring time, like early Spring--So it's no too hot yet.  And um--",6,1703
Okay. You know--you know where?  Or--,6,1704
"I don't know.  I mean, I kinda like the idea of having something outside, but--Like--is a- Yeah,",6,1705
"Uh, huh. I mean, you know, it's spring--It'll be--",6,1706
"But It's sort of hard 'cause the weather is so unpredictable and then if it's like cold that day.  Or if it's too hot, you know, it's like--but um--",4,1707
Spring's nice though.,1,1708
"Yeah, I don't know-[LAUGHTER]-I mean--I can't even--the whole idea of like living--spending my whole life with somebody--that's crazy",6,1709
"Yeah, that is--how long you guys been together now?",6,1710
Two and a half years. [LAUGHTER],6,1711
Okay.  All right.  So-[LAUGHTER]-quite a while.  I mean--That's-  That's good.  I'm so happy for you. [LAUGHTER],1,1712
Thank you. Thank you so much.,1,1713
"Yeah, I'd love to be in that same situation some day, but, wow- so-",5,1714
"Oh, you will--You'll find just the right girl.  And she'll be perfect for you and everything will be great.",6,1715
You guys are awesome together.  It's definitely a--definitely a good couple.  I can see it. I should've guessed--,1,1716
You approve?  You approve?,5,1717
"Oh, I approve. I-[LAUGHTER]-I more than approve.",6,1718
"I mean, I'm surprised he didn't, ya know--go get a plane to fly over and shine--But candles on the beach, that's okay too I guess--",5,1719
"Yeah, it's pretty good.",1,1720
"Well--can--I mean, let me know--I want- I want invitations and--",6,1721
"Of course, of course--you'll be able to be a part of it.  You can come help me pick my colors.",6,1722
"Oh, yes.  This is the whole [GARBAGE]",6,1723
"It's so girly.  I don't even know how to like--It's so weird, but it'll be fun.  My mom will love to be like--she'll get so into it, I'm sure.",1,1724
She'll be like--flowers and the--,6,1725
"It'll be good.  Wow, that's great.",5,1726
"Oh, thank you. [LAUGHTER]",6,1727
"So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?",6,1728
I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling--,6,1729
"No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't",6,1730
"Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like--",6,1731
"Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready.",6,1732
"Yeah--I know what you mean.  I've gone through like similar stuff, but--",6,1733
"But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't--",6,1734
"No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]",4,1735
"I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you--",3,1736
"I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--",6,1737
I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.,0,1738
"No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.",6,1739
"Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that--",6,1740
"There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...",6,1741
...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know,6,1742
"I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand.",6,1743
"I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--",6,1744
"It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--",0,1745
"But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?",6,1746
I feel so worthless.,0,1747
"It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and...",6,1748
... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--,6,1749
And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.,6,1750
"Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-",6,1751
"It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?",6,1752
"Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know",3,1753
Or they'll never talk to me again.,6,1754
"Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE]",6,1755
"I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean--",4,1756
"That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--",6,1757
"I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but",6,1758
Right.,6,533
"Well, you've gotta live.",6,1759
"you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough.",6,1760
"I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--",6,1761
"I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.",6,1762
"Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though.",6,1763
I don't know how to get out of it.  I don't know how to dig myself out of it.  It's the same hole that I've been digging and digging and digging.  I can't--,4,1764
I don't know.,5,257
"Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage.",0,1765
"Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--",4,1766
"No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?",5,1767
"Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the--",4,1768
Some problems?  What is that supposed to mean?,5,1769
"Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-",0,1770
How do you lose a suitcase?  A huge suitcase?,5,1771
"You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen.",6,1772
"Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--",6,1773
How much?,5,1774
"Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--",6,1775
"Fifty dollars?  For my suitcase?  I mean, the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase, but all the things inside, all my clothes, all my personal belongings, the sentimental value, not to mention, which is more-more than all of that together.",5,1776
"Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do.",0,1777
"That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?",6,1778
"I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--",6,1779
"Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere?",5,1780
"Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--",3,1781
"I need my stuff.  It's--I need my stuff.  I mean, uh...",6,1782
Haven't you ever lost baggage?  I mean isn't there anything else you do?,5,1783
"Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um",0,1784
"Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.",6,1785
"By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--",4,1786
I didn't sign anything.,3,1787
"Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--",6,1788
"I didn't agree.  [GARBAGE] I paid the airline to take care of things for me.  When you pay for something, there should be some sort of guarantee that it's gonna come through.",6,1789
"You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?",6,1790
"[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?",6,1791
"Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--",6,1792
But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.,6,1793
"No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you",6,1794
Isn't there anything else you can do?,6,1795
probably even talk to--,6,1796
"I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen?",5,1797
"Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh",6,1798
"Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how--",6,1799
but Unfortunately sometimes is--,0,1800
"Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--",6,1801
There needs to be better security here.,6,1802
"Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.",6,1803
It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.,6,1804
"All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.",6,1805
"Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please?",6,1806
"Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.",6,1807
Thank you.,6,247
Thank you very much.,1,1057
"Hey, a what's up?",5,1808
"Um, Johnny died yesterday.",0,1809
"Wow, that's horrible.",6,1810
I'm sorry to hear about that.,0,1811
"We knew that it was coming, but--",4,1812
Yeah.,6,2
"It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well.",6,1813
"I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right?",6,1814
Yeah.,6,2
"It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that.",0,1815
I just don't want him to be gone.,3,1816
It's okay.,6,241
"'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on.",6,1817
I mean--I don't know.,5,1818
And his whole family was there.,6,1819
"I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know",6,1820
"Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than...",1,1821
".than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean--",4,1822
"He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about...",6,1823
...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--,6,1824
"But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and--",6,1825
Nobody's ever gonna forget him.,6,1826
"Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and",6,1827
"And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean--",1,1828
He did a lot.  But--,6,1829
"I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but--",6,1830
"But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--",6,1831
I'm gonna forget him.,0,1832
"No, you'll never forget him.",6,1833
I won't be able to hear his voice or his--,0,1834
I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--,6,1835
You start to lose like that image after a while.,6,1836
"That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so .",6,1837
"It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now.",6,1838
Thanks.,6,1839
"So, how's it going?",6,1840
"It's going really well.  Um, I received something in the mail today.",1,1841
"Oh, you got what?  Where?",5,1842
I got into U.S.C.,6,1843
"Oh, no way.",6,1677
"Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say--",1,1844
Are you gonna go? you gonna-,3,1845
"Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway.",6,1846
So--,6,1847
"Wow, that's...",5,1848
"...that's first choice, huh? That's so awesome and now look you're gonna be--you're gonna be here. you know",1,1849
"Yeah, I know.",6,1850
Absolutely. I'm so excited.,1,1851
"I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like...",6,1852
"...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school",1,1853
"Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna..",6,1854
Yeah.,6,2
"and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like...",6,1855
Yeah,6,1856
Fight on.,6,1857
"You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C.",6,1858
"And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you...",6,1859
[LAUGHTER],6,452
Wow. That's cool.,5,1860
"...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean?",1,1861
Like it has some prestige. so,6,1862
Yeah. Hey. Prestigious school.,1,1863
"So, what, do you have to send in your deposit now?  Or what you-?",5,1864
"Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine--",6,1865
"Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind.",6,1866
That's great.,1,1867
I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know--,4,1868
Yeah.,6,2
So...,6,1869
"Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know",6,1870
"Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess.",6,1871
"I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited.",1,1872
That'll be awesome.,1,1873
"I mean because you went to the campus before, right?",6,1874
"Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate.",1,1875
"You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want.",6,1876
So what're you--what're you gonna do there?  Have you decided?  Thought about it?,5,1877
"Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first...",6,1878
"I know.  I mean, it's good all around.",1,1879
"...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean?",6,1880
"So, um, so I don't know.",6,1881
[LAUGHTER],6,452
I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.,6,1882
Oh man.,5,1883
"I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean.",6,1884
I always see people walking around with like U.S.C stuff on--,6,1885
"I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C..  You know what I mean.",6,1886
You know is like.,6,1887
I know.,6,39
Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE],6,1888
"You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome.",6,1889
And you'll be like...,6,1890
"Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much.",1,1891
[BREATHING],6,428
A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set.,6,1892
I know.  I'm excited.,1,1893
"Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE]",6,1894
"I know, that's a ways down the road. That's cool.",1,1895
That's going to be a lot of work.,6,1896
"But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun.",1,1897
In LA. Oh man.,5,1898
"I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good.",6,1899
So much.,6,1900
"But it's LA, you know, everything.",6,1901
You're getting close to the beach.  I mean geez.,5,1902
I know. I know. So fun.  I can't wait.,1,1903
"Cool.  Well give me a call, you know when--You get in town. definitely Awesome.",1,1904
I will. I will. Thank you.,1,1905
Thanks.,6,1839
"Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you?",6,1906
"Yeah, hello.",6,1907
Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.,0,1908
"All right, sir.",6,1909
"I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because--",0,1910
I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.,6,1911
Okay.,6,185
"Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?",4,1912
"Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-",6,1913
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.",6,1914
"I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,",6,1915
"um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.",1,1916
You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.,6,1917
Is that all right?,6,1918
"I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.",6,1919
All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-,6,1920
[BREATHING] that's good.,1,1921
"um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.",6,1922
"All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.",1,1923
Absolutely. we we,6,1924
"Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.",6,1925
"So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.",6,1926
Okay. So--,6,1927
Yeah.,6,2
"Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a",6,1928
Okay.,6,185
#NAME?,1,1025
Great.  How many seats?,5,1929
"Well, it's gonna be four of them.",6,1930
Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.,1,1931
All right.  And can they like all get together?,6,1932
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?",6,1933
"Um- You know, window is nice. I guess",6,1934
"Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?",6,1935
"All right, Sure.  A yeah, that- that'd be good.",1,1936
Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?,1,1937
"Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--",6,1938
All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.,6,1939
"So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.",6,1940
"And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.",6,1941
Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.,6,1942
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.,6,1943
"Okay.  Wow.  Sounds good then, I guess.  Thank you very much. It's a lot better than talking to a machine.",1,1944
Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.,6,1945
All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.,6,1946
Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.,1,1947
Okay.,6,185
Thank you.,6,247
What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,6,1948
He saw it.,6,318
"How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",5,1949
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,5,1950
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,5,1951
"I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",5,1952
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.,0,1953
He cried hard?,5,1954
I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,4,1955
What was he doing out here at that hour?,5,1956
He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,4,1957
I guess he is.,6,325
He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,6,1958
"I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",4,1959
What?,5,328
"Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",6,1960
What you mean dishonest?,3,1961
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,5,1962
What do you want to do argue with him?,3,1963
"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore?",6,1964
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?,4,1965
You can't say that to him.,6,335
We've got to say it to him.,6,336
Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?,5,1966
"For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",5,1967
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?",6,1968
"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,340
"Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry.",4,1969
All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,6,1970
Why?,5,343
You know.,6,344
"I've got an idea, but what's the story?",6,1971
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,1,1972
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",6,1195
You know it's not only my business.,6,1973
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,6,1974
So it's all right then?,6,1975
I'll go ahead with it?,6,1976
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to--",6,1977
"Well, then it isn't just my business--",6,1978
I'm just saying that--,6,1979
"Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",3,1980
I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,6,1981
She's not Larry's girl.,6,356
"From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.",6,1982
"And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",6,1983
"I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.",3,1984
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,6,1985
To hell with that.,3,361
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?,5,1986
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.",6,1987
"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",6,1988
"Trouble is, you don't see enough women.",6,1989
You never did.,6,1990
"So what, I'm not fast with women.",6,1991
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,1992
Because it is.,6,370
"Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.",6,1993
"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her.",0,1994
"These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",6,1995
"I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.",6,1996
"I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.",4,1997
"All right.  All right, then, Mom.",6,1998
I just--give it some more thought.,6,1999
I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,6,2000
"But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",0,2001
What the hell is this?,3,383
I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.,6,2002
Are you crazy?,3,385
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,1,2003
What about the business?  What the hell is this?,5,2004
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0,388
Must you be inspired?,6,2005
"Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",3,2006
"I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it?",0,2007
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",3,2008
"Yes, on this I would.",6,1228
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",6,1229
Then help me stay here.,6,395
"All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you.",6,2009
"I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.",6,2010
"All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?",3,2011
I am thinkin' that way.,6,2012
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",4,1236
I can see that.,6,402
Why did he invite her here?,5,403
Why does that bother you?,3,404
She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?,5,2013
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",6,2014
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,407
What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?,5,2015
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,3,2016
She's not-,6,2017
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,5,2018
-he's not gonna marry her.,0,2019
It's got that all about it.,6,2020
"Well, so what?",3,2021
"What's going on here, Joe?",5,2022
"Now, listen Kate.",6,2023
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",6,2024
You can't read her mind.,6,417
"Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.",5,2025
How do you know why she's waited?,5,2026
"She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,2027
"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",1,2028
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",3,2029
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?",3,2030
I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.,6,2031
But Kate--,6,2032
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",3,2033
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,5,2034
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.",0,2035
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.",6,2036
All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.,6,2037
"You, above all, have to believe.",6,2038
What?- Why- Why me above all?,5,2039
Just--just don't stop believing.,3,2040
What does that mean?  Me above all?,5,2041
Look at you.  Look at you shaking.,4,2042
I can't help it.,0,434
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,5,2043
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,6,2044
"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",6,2045
It's all right.  It's a good thing.,1,2046
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",1,2047
You're not sorry you came?,5,1269
"No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.",0,2048
Why?,5,343
"Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",6,2049
Oh.,6,103
"You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",6,2050
What?,5,328
"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",6,2051
"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.",6,2052
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",6,1275
"Well,",6,2053
"from her point of view, why else would I come?",3,2054
"Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",5,2055
I--I guess this is why I came.,6,2056
"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",1,2057
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,6,2058
I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,0,2059
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",0,2060
"Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",6,2061
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,5,2062
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me and--,3,2063
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Every day since.,6,463
"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",3,2064
"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.",6,2065
"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",6,2066
"oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",5,2067
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,5,2068
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",1,2069
Not like that you're not.,6,472
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",5,2070
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,0,2071
"No.  What is it, your mother?",5,2072
No.  Nothing like that.,6,2073
"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",6,2074
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",6,2075
You've gotta tell me.,6,2076
I don't know how to start.,4,2077
It wouldn't work this way.,6,2078
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",5,2079
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
"Well, I lost them.",0,2080
How many?,5,487
Just about all.,6,2081
"Oh, gee.",6,2082
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,6,2083
"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",6,2084
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",3,2085
"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",6,2086
"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",6,2087
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,5,2088
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",0,2089
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",6,2090
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,6,2091
You still feel that way?,5,2092
I want you now Annie.,6,2093
"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.",6,2094
"I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",3,2095
"I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.",1,2096
What'll I do with a fortune?,3,2097
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.,5,2098
"This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.",5,2099
"I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.",4,2100
How you doing?,5,2101
Fine.,3,507
Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.,5,2102
"Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",4,2103
"How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",5,2104
What flashlight?,5,513
"You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",5,2105
That's not your flashlight.,6,515
Who's is it?,5,2106
It's ours.  It's mine too.,6,2107
"Oh, well sure.",6,2108
"You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?",5,2109
"Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",6,2110
How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,6,2111
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",5,2112
Yeah.,6,2
"You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.",5,2113
"This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.",5,2114
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,5,2115
You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,5,2116
I'm cold.,0,528
Do you want my jacket?,6,529
"It's after eleven, let's just go home.",6,2117
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.,5,2118
There is no point in coming down here.,6,2119
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
That's my point too.,6,1350
"So, let's go.",6,2120
No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?,3,2121
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I just don't.  It's stupid.,3,539
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.",6,2122
"Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",6,2123
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",6,2124
"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",6,2125
this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,1,2126
"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",5,2127
Yeah they do.,6,545
"Ah, Augie.",6,2128
Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,6,2129
There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,5,2130
I'm just not.,6,549
For real?,5,550
Yeah.,6,2
"I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",5,2131
"And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.",6,2132
"Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.",6,2133
We weren't in a good spot.,0,2134
We didn't see them the first time either.,5,2135
"We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.",6,2136
There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?,6,2137
"Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.",5,2138
"Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.",6,2139
"They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-",5,2140
"all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.",6,2141
It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.,6,2142
"They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",6,2143
"Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.",5,2144
That's the wind.,6,565
"Well, so what do you think?",6,2145
About what?,5,567
What I was saying.,6,2146
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
"Well, so what do you think?",6,2145
About what?,5,567
What I was saying.,6,2146
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,573
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.,5,2148
"Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.",6,2149
"Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.",1,2150
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",6,2151
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",6,2152
"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",3,2153
"Well, what's bugging you?",3,2154
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,6,2155
"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",4,2156
"For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",6,2157
Why not?,6,179
"We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?",5,2158
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,6,2159
Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,6,2160
"Well, we'll see them this year.",6,2161
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.",0,2162
"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",6,2163
I thought you wanted to see it.,6,591
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,3,1408
"No, of course not.",6,2164
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,6,2165
It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.,6,2166
"For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.",6,2167
"All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.",6,2168
"I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.",6,2169
"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""",1,2170
"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",6,2171
"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",6,2172
"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",5,2173
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",6,2174
"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",1,2175
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,6,2176
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",6,2177
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",6,2178
"Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",6,2179
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,6,2180
"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",1,2181
No.,6,136
You want me to go get some champagne?,3,1426
No.,6,136
Take off our shoes?,5,2182
No. No.,6,2183
"Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?",5,2184
No.,6,136
You wanna get married again?,5,2185
No.,6,136
What?  What?  You want a divorce?,5,2186
No.,6,136
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
"A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?",5,2187
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,6,1432
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",6,2188
"No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?",5,2189
"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",1,2190
"'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",6,2191
This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,2192
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,2193
Right.,6,533
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,6,2194
"I know, me neither.",6,2195
"I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",6,2196
I'm doing the best I can.,6,630
"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",6,2197
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",5,2198
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,6,2199
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",0,2200
"Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",6,2201
Yeah?,5,636
"Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?",3,2202
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,6,2203
"Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",6,2204
"Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",6,2205
"I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",5,2206
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.",5,2207
"Well, look what we have here.",6,2208
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",6,1457
It's not champagne.,6,647
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",6,2209
You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?,5,2210
No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.,6,2211
"Augie, I'm sorry.",0,651
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,4,2212
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Good God.,5,654
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
"Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,2213
"Must be them, then.",6,2214
What're we gonna do?,3,2215
"We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens.",6,2216
"Now and always, sweet.",6,661
I don't care then.,6,662
It was bound to come sooner or later.,6,2217
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,5,2218
"Ah, it send shivers up my spine.",4,2219
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,5,2220
Behave exquisitely.,6,2221
With the most perfect poise?,6,2222
"Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.",6,2223
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?,4,2224
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,4,2225
"Oh, darling, don't say that.",6,2226
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,6,2227
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",6,2228
"Yes, meaning just that.",6,2229
"Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,2230
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,0,2231
"You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.",3,2232
Who's they?,5,680
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.,1,2233
Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,6,2234
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",1,2235
"Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.",1,2236
"Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.",6,2237
Who knows.,6,2238
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",6,2239
"No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.",0,2240
"Oh, dear, shall we like that?",6,2241
Depends on how well we've played.,6,2242
"Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?",6,2243
Yes.  Yes. With all his might.,6,2244
"That's serious enough, isn't it?",3,2245
"No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",6,2246
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",3,2247
So is everyone else in the long run.,6,2248
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.",1,2249
"Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",6,2250
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",6,2251
"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.",3,2252
"Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",3,2253
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,2254
Which particular one?,6,703
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,6,2255
Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,6,2256
"Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it.",6,2257
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",0,2258
How long did that row last?,6,709
It went in intermittently for days.,6,2259
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,2260
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,6,2261
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",6,713
That was the first time you ever hit me.,5,2262
I didn't hit you very hard.,6,2263
"The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.",6,2264
"Oh, I'll never forget his face.",6,2265
It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.,6,2266
We were very much younger then.,6,722
And very much sillier.,1,723
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
"Honey, you knew there was nothing in that.",5,2268
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,6,724
Presents?  Just a trivial little broach.,6,2269
"Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,2270
"No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.",6,2271
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
"No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",6,2272
"You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he?",6,2273
"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",6,2274
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,6,2275
"Well, what of it?",3,731
What of it?,5,732
It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it.,1,2276
"Well, what about me?",6,2277
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",6,2278
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",1,2279
I'm bored with this conversation.,0,1545
"Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?",0,2280
"No, thanks.",6,2281
I think I'll have some.,6,2282
Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.,5,2283
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,6,2284
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,2285
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,6,2286
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",6,2287
"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",6,2288
Don't be so stupid.,3,2289
"Really, Amanda.",5,748
What?,5,328
Nothing.,6,749
Going out somewhere dear?,5,2290
"No, just making myself fascinating for you.",6,2291
That reply has broken my heart.,0,752
"A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",6,2292
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",6,2293
"No, it isn't.",6,2294
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"Oh, be quiet.",6,2295
"Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.",0,2296
Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,5,2297
"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",3,2298
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",3,760
Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,3,2299
They sting.,3,1567
They snap.,3,2300
"I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.",3,2301
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,6,763
"Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",5,2302
"Hmm, I imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then.",6,2303
Mind your own business.,6,766
"Oh, must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all.  Very enjoyable and never had much anyhow.",1,2304
You're quite insufferable,3,2305
I expect it's because you're drunk.,6,2306
I'm not in the least drunk.,6,2307
You've always had a weak head.,6,769
"As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",6,2308
"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,2309
"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?",5,2310
Shut up.,3,774
"We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.",6,2311
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",5,2312
All right.  I will.,6,2313
"You better turn that off, I think.",6,2314
Why?,5,343
Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,3,2315
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,6,2316
There are people downstairs I suppose?,5,2317
They're away in Tunis.,6,2318
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,6,2319
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
I'll do no such thing.,3,2320
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",6,2321
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,3,2322
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,3,2323
Turn it off.,6,787
Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.,3,2324
"Amanda, listen. listen",6,2325
"Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",4,2326
"Very amusing, indeed.",1,2327
"I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",3,2328
"You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.",6,2329
This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.,6,2330
You're not going like this.,6,794
"Oh Yes, I am.",6,2331
You're not.,6,796
I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,3,2332
Shut up. Shut up.,3,2333
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,3,2334
I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,6,2335
Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,3,2336
You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,6,2337
All right. Finally. Here you go.,6,2338
"Hi, How can I help you?",4,2339
"Yea. I just want to get this done,",6,2340
"Sure, um",6,2341
get my new license.,6,2342
do you have two forms of ID with you?,6,2343
"Um, no, I got my driver's license though.",6,2344
"I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.",0,2345
"Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -",0,2346
Well,6,2347
well is the dri-driver's license going to work?,6,2348
I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.,6,2349
"Okay, so what are you saying? What-",3,2350
"Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.",6,2351
"What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after",5,2352
"Well, I'm sorry sir but",0,2353
three hours and,6,2354
you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.,6,2355
Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?,5,2356
"Well, it's actually-",6,2357
"It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry.",0,2358
"It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my",6,2359
"Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible.",0,2360
"I filled out the application right, didn't I?",6,2361
"Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.",6,2362
Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-,6,2363
"I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again.",0,2364
I've been waiting for three hours.,6,2365
"It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you.",0,2366
This is ridiculous. Come on,3,2367
"I'm sorry, sir.",0,2368
"I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-",6,2369
there is nothing I can do.,0,2370
"But my driver's license - I had to have my birth certificate to get my driver's license in the first place right, I mean this - here is my driver's license so",6,2371
"I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry.",0,2372
That doesn't make any sense. Why?,6,2373
"I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do.",0,2374
You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application,6,2375
"Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said.",6,2376
If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.,6,2377
"What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.",5,2378
"Well, maybe you should",6,2379
I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.,6,2380
Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.,6,2381
"I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.",0,2382
"God, oh my-",5,2383
This is ridiculous.,6,2384
"I'm sorry, sir, it's not my choice.",0,2385
I don't want you to go.,0,2386
"I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.",0,2387
"I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.",0,2388
I don't want to be a single mom.,0,2389
"You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and",6,2390
but,6,2391
and,6,2392
It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll,4,2393
"It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with,",4,2394
"I'll come back we'll have, you know, some good benefits from being in the service and then we'll live - we'll live a happy life, then the rest of us, like the three of us.",1,2395
I hope so.,6,2396
A little family.,1,2397
I hope so.,6,2396
You gotta,6,2398
It's going to be really rough.,6,2399
"You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?",3,2400
I'll send you lots of pictures.,6,2401
"I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.",6,2402
I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.,6,2403
"Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.",6,2404
"I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get",6,2405
"No, it doesn't work that way",6,2406
"but, I mean, I'm going to do whatever I can and get back here as fast as I can.",6,2407
It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.,6,2408
"I know, but it's not our decision, I guess, you know, I mean",6,2409
there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country,6,2410
"and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back",6,2411
"Will you write me letters, paper ones?",6,2412
"Yeah, of course. I don't know if we'll have computers or anything like that you know, so probably my only option then.",6,2413
"Yeah, I'll write you every day 'cause you're the only thing that's going to be on my mind.",6,2414
"Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.",6,2415
"Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.",1,2416
"I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.",0,2417
I'll miss you too.,0,2418
"Oh, you're never going to believe it.",5,2419
What? What? You look really happy what's going on?,5,2420
"Well, I finally did it",6,2421
Finally did what?,5,2422
I-I asked her to marry me.,4,2423
"You did? Oh, my Gosh, I'm so proud of you.",5,2424
"Yes, I know. [LAUGHTER]",6,2425
"Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did",5,2426
"I'm so nervous you know, I'm-",4,2427
Did she say yes?,5,2428
"Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know",6,2429
That's like the most definitive.,6,2430
I know Uhm- I can't believe it.  It's like-,5,2431
"Oh, my gosh, wait so when did you decide to do this, I mean,",5,2432
I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.,5,2433
"Well, yes, I wanted it you know I guess sort of as a surprise for everyone so",5,2434
"Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?",5,2435
"Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know",1,2436
Yeah.,6,2
"I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.",6,2437
So what did you do?,5,2438
"Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah",6,2439
so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-,6,2440
"Oh, You did not.",5,2441
I-I did.,6,2442
"Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute",5,2443
"So I got the band to do something, you know, like towards the end of the song I got to go up on stage and, uh",6,2444
"That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God.",5,2445
"I know, so",6,2446
I got to freak her out.,3,2447
"No, yes -- so",6,2448
She must have flipped out.,6,2449
"Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.",6,2450
Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER],6,2451
"No, but it was good.",1,2452
Did you bring her up on stage too?,5,2453
"Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]",6,2454
"Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.",5,2455
"I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.",1,2456
Are your parents excited or...?,5,2457
"Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...",1,2458
"Yea, totally. So when is it going to happen?",6,2459
"Well, we're thinking uh - we're thinking winter time, you know, we're going to do it in the winter and then maybe, you know, maybe",6,2460
"I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia, Southern Hemisphere, [GARBAGE] so we'll decide with that.",6,2461
"Ooh, that would be fun.",1,2462
"Do you think you'll get a house or something, like you guys are looking to buy some place or",6,2463
"Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first",6,2464
Yeah. [LAUGHTER],6,2465
but like you know it's just - I guess we're just excited right now that we'll get to continue it together.,1,2466
"Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.",5,2467
I know.,6,39
"Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]",1,2468
"Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.",6,2469
Did you have a good ring? You better have had a good ring.,0,2470
"Sure. Oh, yes.",6,2471
Good. The ring makes all the difference.,6,2472
You know I had my mom come along maybe help me out a little bit because she's got good taste. but,6,2473
"Oh, that's awesome.",1,2474
"Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah",1,2475
"Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.",1,2476
Hah.,6,2477
"Uhm, I don't know",5,2478
So how you feeling?,6,2479
I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean,5,2480
"I have got to get a job, you know? Like-",0,2481
"You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?",6,2482
"Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-",6,2483
"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",6,2484
"I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",6,2485
"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",6,2486
"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",6,2487
"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",6,2488
"I don't know, I mean why - why",5,2489
"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",6,2490
"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",6,2491
"Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like",6,2492
"I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",3,2493
"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",6,2494
"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",3,2495
You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,6,2496
"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",4,2497
"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",6,2498
"I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and",0,2499
I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,6,2500
I'm sorry.,0,2501
"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",6,2502
"maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",6,2503
"Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",6,2504
Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,6,2505
"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",6,2506
"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",6,2507
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,6,2508
"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",0,2509
"It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.",6,2510
this doesn't happen to a normal person.,6,2511
"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",6,2512
"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",6,2513
"I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",6,2514
"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",6,2515
What am I going to do on a break?,6,2516
"Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.",3,2517
Right. Thanks for talking to me.,1,2518
Hi. Um-,6,2519
"Hi, can I help you?",4,2520
It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.,5,2521
"Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-",6,2522
"Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.",6,2523
"Okay. Well, um- the f.",3,2524
"Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-",6,2525
Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know,4,2526
"Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-",6,2527
"For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",5,2528
"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",6,2529
Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,5,2530
What? What? How does that happen?,5,2531
"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",4,2532
I really - I really need that bag.,5,2533
"I- I- I understand, but um.",4,2534
there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got,6,2535
Okay,6,2536
"I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there",1,2537
Right.,6,533
It's worth a lot.,1,2538
"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",6,2539
"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",6,2540
can they check there?,6,2541
"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",3,2542
on another-,6,2543
"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",6,2544
So we'll- what we'll do,6,2545
"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",6,2546
see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-,6,2547
Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.,6,2548
Theft?,5,2549
"Um, so.",6,2550
"Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",3,2551
"We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know",6,2552
I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.,0,2553
This is unbelievable. I've got,5,2554
you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay,5,2555
"I understand, so-",6,2556
"so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do",6,2557
"I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?",3,2558
"all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage",6,2559
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-,6,2560
You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage],6,2561
"I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.",6,2562
Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.,6,2563
"Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",6,2564
"Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on",6,2565
"that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.",6,2566
The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,0,2567
The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,5,2568
Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,6,2569
"we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-",6,2570
I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do,3,2571
because this is ridiculous?,3,2572
I'm sorry. I don't- I-,0,2573
I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-,0,2574
All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.,0,2575
There's other people waiting-,6,2576
Fine.,3,507
What's going on?,5,2577
Kathy died last night.,0,2578
"Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry.",5,2579
"yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -",6,2580
"I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.",6,2581
"It doesn't make any easier, yes.",6,2582
"I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,",6,2583
"Oh, man. I'm so sorry.",0,2584
"She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it.",6,2585
"It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.",0,2586
"Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but",6,2587
"God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go",5,2588
Yeah.,6,2
"out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean.",6,2589
Totally.,6,2590
"It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know",6,2591
Yeah,6,1856
"not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.",6,2592
"Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.",6,2593
She was [garbage],6,2594
"She really cared about you, you know.",6,2595
"Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great",6,2596
so loving everybody you know.,1,2597
And she was,5,2598
"Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.",3,2599
Yeah.,6,2
We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.,6,2600
Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.,6,2601
Yes.  [BREATHING] God.,5,2602
Are you going to be okay?,3,2603
"I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it",6,2604
"just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.",6,2605
Then she's gone.,6,2606
"It's going to be okay, I promise.",6,2607
"Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps",1,2608
Sure,6,2609
to talk to somebody but,6,2610
you shouldn't be alone,0,2611
"It's just going to take a while, I think.",6,2612
Yes.,6,192
Ah.,6,1506
Thank you.,6,247
Yes.,6,192
"[BREATHING] So, you know I've been hearing back from some colleges.",6,2613
"Oh, yeah? Have you gotten letters yet?",5,2614
Yeah. And guess who accepted me?,6,2615
"Um, I don't know, where?",5,2616
U.S.C..,6,2617
"Oh, U.S.C.? Oh my Gosh, that's awesome, that was your top choice, right?",5,2618
"Oh my Gosh, that's so cool.",5,2619

"I'm looking forward to getting there. I mean, God, the campus is cool, you know it's like all just very confined I mean just you know it's a college campus you know it's like",6,2658
"Yes, it's intimate.",6,2659

I know. It's so cool.,1,2661
"Oh man. So, I don't know you know, we'll see - we'll see how it goes and, yeah, I'm looking forward to it",6,2662
"Fair for you, Wow, oh my Gosh.",5,2663

"Well, there are all kinds of awesome secrets so you'll really enjoy it. It's really great. I'm so glad.",1,2666
"Oh, alright.",6,2667

"[LAUGHTER] Thanks, yes, thanks, yes That'll be cool.",6,2672
So Congratulations. That's awesome.,1,2673
All right. Customer service this is Steve.,6,2674
"Hi. Thank you so much, you're a real person, right, you're not like a recording?",6,2675
"I'm a real person, yes.",6,2676
"Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-",6,2677
"it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there.",6,2678
"Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.",0,2679
"So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles",6,2680
"like press nine, press zero, press back to the menu, like I can't get through to what I'm supposed to get through to.",6,2681
"I- I'll give you a little hint, next time if it asks if you're on a rotary phone you know, just stay on the line instead of - instead of hitting one or two to say if you're like on a touch tone",6,2682
"pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.",6,2683
"Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice.",1,2684
I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.,6,2685
"Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes",0,2686
Alright. Well you got me now.,6,2687
"Thank you very much. Um  So I have a charge on my credit card that, um, isn't mine.",6,2688
"Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so",6,2689
it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I don't -- I didn't spend this. This is not my charge.,6,2690
"Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think",6,2691
"Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something",6,2692
"Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here.",6,2693
"and it was like something like eight hundred dollars. I don't remember. It was just a lot and I have thing in front of me right now, but-",5,2694
"All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's",6,2695
Okay. So is there something I can do to get rid of it?,6,2696
it- it'll work out fine.,6,2697
"Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay.",6,2698
"So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website.",6,2699
"Oh I can get the form right now? Oh, that'll be so much better.  Okay.",6,2700
Yeah. Yeah. You get the form right now. and- yeah,6,2701
"We could mail it to you as well, but-",6,2702
#NAME?,6,1025
"Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-",3,2703
and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know,6,2704
Okay.,6,185
'Cause I-I just don't know how someone could have gotten my charge information,5,2705
I mean I still have my card.,6,2706
Right. I mean we might,6,2707
Okay.,6,185
So is there any- I mean what if they spend something again?,6,2708
"Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-",5,2709
I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-,5,2710
"Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so",6,2711
so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.,6,2712
"Oh, really?",5,2713
"Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-",6,2714
"Oh that'll be great 'cause I could just get a new number, would that be okay because that way I don't have to worry about it happening again?",6,2715
it's a different number and everything,6,2716
Yeah. yeah.,6,2717
"Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?",6,2718
"Yes, absolutely.",6,2719
Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And,6,2720
Great.,1,2721
And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um,6,2722
Yeah.,6,2
if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and,6,2723
"and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-",4,2724
"Right, right.",6,2725
"Okay, great.",1,2726
"Yeah, totally.",6,2632
you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.,0,2727
Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.,1,2728
"Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of.",0,2729
[BREATHING] Thank you.,1,2730
Thank you very much bye.,1,2731
"What's he going to say, maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.",6,2732
He saw it.,6,318
How could he see it? I was the first one up he was still in bed.,5,2733
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,5,2734
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,5,1951
I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.,6,2735
So you talked to him?,5,2736
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,6,2737
He cried hard?,5,1954
I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,4,2738
"What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night.",6,2739
I guess he is.,6,325
He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?,6,2740
"I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.",4,2741
What?,5,328
Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,6,2742
What do you mean dishonest?,3,330
You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,6,2743
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",3,1185
"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",6,2744
"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",4,2745
You can't say that to him.,6,335
We've got to say it to him.,6,336
"Can you prove it, how can you prove it?",3,2746
"For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.",5,2747
To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?,6,2748
Sit down mom; I want to talk to you.,4,2749
"The trouble is the god damned newspapers, every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere, so the next one is going to be Larry.",6,2750
All right. All right. Listen to me.,3,2751
You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,6,2752
You know.,6,344
I got an idea but what's the story?,6,2753
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1,346
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",6,347
No it's not only my business.,6,2754
What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.,6,2755
So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?,6,2756
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-",6,2757
See it isn't just my business-,6,2758
I'm just saying,6,2759
Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.,3,2760
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,6,2761
She's not Larry's girl.,6,356
From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,6,2762
"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",6,2763
"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",3,2764
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,6,1985
To hell with that.,3,361
Have you asked Annie yet?,6,2765
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,6,2766
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",6,2767
"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",6,2768
"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",0,2769
So what I'm not fast with women.,6,2770
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,1992
Because it is.,6,370
That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.,6,2771
"I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.",6,2772
"What do you want, a diagram?",6,2773
"I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.",6,2774
"Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?",3,2775
All right. All right. Mom.,6,2776
Just give it some more thought.,6,380
"I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.",6,2777
"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",0,2778
What the hell is this?,3,383
"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",6,2779
"What the hell is this, are you crazy?",3,2780
"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",0,2781
What about the business? What is this?,5,2782
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0,388
Must you be inspired?,6,2005
"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",6,2783
I want a family; I want kids; I want something I can give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?,6,2784
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",3,2008
"Yes, on this I would.",6,1228
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",6,1229
Then help me stay here.,6,395
"All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you.",6,2785
I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.,6,2786
Just don't go thinking that way.,3,2787
"Well, I am thinking that way.",6,2788
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",6,2789
"Yea, I can see that.",6,2790
Why did he invite her here?,5,403
Why does that bother you?,3,404
She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,5,2791
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",6,2014
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,407
"What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?",5,2792
"Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",3,2793
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,5,2018
It's got that all about it.,6,2020
"Well, so what?",3,2021
What's going on here Joe?,5,2794
"All right. Now, listen kid-",3,2795
-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,6,2796
You can't read her mind.,6,417
"Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.",5,2797
How do you know why she has waited?,5,2798
"She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,2799
"Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?",1,2800
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",3,2801
What do you want me to do about it?,3,2802
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",3,2803
But Kate,5,2804
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but",3,2805
"why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces, just look at it, look.",5,2806
Calm yourself.,6,429
I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.,4,2807
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",6,2808
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,6,2809
Just you above all need to believe.,6,2810
"Wait, why my above all?",5,2811
Don't stop believing.,3,2812
"What does that mean, me above all?",5,2813
Look at you -- look at you shaking.,4,2814
I can't help it.,0,434
"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",3,2815
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,6,2044
"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",6,2045
It's all right.  It's a good thing.,1,2046
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",1,2047
You're not sorry you came?,5,1269
"No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.",0,2816
Why?,5,343
"For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",6,2817
Oh.,6,103
"You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",6,2050
What?,5,328
"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",6,2051
"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.",6,2818
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",6,1275
How'd you know?,5,2819
"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",6,2820
"Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",5,2055
I guess this is why I came.,6,2821
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",1,2822
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,6,2058
I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,0,2059
"You feel wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",0,2823
"Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",6,2061
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,5,2062
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
"Well, you started to write me",6,2824
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Every day since.,6,463
"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",5,2825
"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know?",6,2826
"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",6,2066
"God, I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",5,2827
"I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean, all I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.",5,2828
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",1,2069
Not like that you're not.,6,472
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",5,2070
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,0,2071
"No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother?",5,2829
No.  Nothing like that.,6,2073
"Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",6,2830
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",6,2075
You've gotta tell me.,6,2076
I don't know how to start.,4,2077
It wouldn't work this way.,6,2078
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company?",5,2831
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
"Well, I lost them.",0,2080
How many?,5,487
Just about all.,6,2081
gee.,6,2832
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,6,2083
"For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.",6,2833
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",3,2834
"I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?",6,2835
"To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",6,2836
"Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",5,2837
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",0,2838
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",6,2839
Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,6,2840
Do you still feel that way?,6,499
I want you now Annie.,6,2093
"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",6,2841
"I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",3,2842
I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you.,1,2843
What'll I do with a fortune?,3,2097
What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.,5,2844
"God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.",5,2845
"I would have wanted to go a little further up the coast, get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid we'd miss it.",4,2846
How you doing?,5,2101
Fine.,3,507
"Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.",5,2847
"Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",6,2848
How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?,5,2849
What flashlight?,5,513
"You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?",5,2850
That's not your flashlight.,6,515
Who's is it?,5,2106
It's ours; it's mine too.,6,2851
"Oh well, sure, yes.",6,2852
But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?,5,2853
"No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight, es su flashlight, naturally.",6,2854
How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,6,2111
"I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year, do you remember?",5,2855
Yea.,6,2856
"You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?",3,2857
"Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,",5,2858
"oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.",5,2859
You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,6,2860
I'm cold.,0,528
What you want my jacket?,6,2861
It's after eleven. Let's just go home.,6,2862
"Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?",3,2863
There is no point in coming down here.,6,2119
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
That's my point too.,6,1350
So let's go.,6,2864
No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,3,2865
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
"I don't, it's just stupid.",3,2866
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.",6,2867
"Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.",6,2868
"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.",6,2869
"Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.",6,2870
"This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.",6,2871
What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,5,2872
Yes they do.,6,2873
Augie,6,2874
"Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs",6,2875
"you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.",5,2876
I'm just not.,6,549
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.,5,2877
"And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.",5,2878
"Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",6,2879
We weren't in a good spot.,0,2134
We didn't see them the first time either.,5,2135
We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,6,2880
"There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?",6,2881
"This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.",6,2882
"Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,",6,2883
"they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.",5,2884
"Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.",6,2885
"It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,",6,2886
"they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",6,2887
Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.,3,2888
That's the wind.,6,565
"Well, so what do you think?",6,2145
About what?,5,567
What I was saying.,6,2146
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
So what do you think?,6,566
About what?,5,567
What I was saying.,6,2146
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,2889
It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,6,2890
"Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.",6,2891
"Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.",6,2892
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,0,2893
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",6,2894
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,3,2895
"Well, what's bugging you?",3,2154
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,6,2155
"There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.",6,2896
For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.,6,2897
Why not?,6,179
"We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?",5,2898
We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,6,2899
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",6,2900
"Well, we'll see them this year.",6,2161
"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",6,2901
I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,1,2902
I thought you wanted to see them.,6,2903
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,3,1408
No of course not.,6,2904
"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",6,2905
"It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.",6,2906
For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,6,2907
All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.,6,2908
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",6,2909
"""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",1,2910
"okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-",6,2911
Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,6,2912
"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",6,2913
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,6,2914
"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",1,2915
Wait a minute I've got it,5,2916
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",6,2177
"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",6,2917
"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",6,2918
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,6,2919
"Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",6,2920
No.,6,136
You want to go get some champagne?,5,2921
No.,6,136
Take off our shoes?,5,2182
No.,6,136
"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",5,2922
No.,6,136
Get married again?,5,2923
No.,6,136
What? What? You want a divorce?,5,2924
No.,6,136
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
"A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?",5,2925
I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,6,2926
"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",6,2927
"You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?",5,2928
"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",1,2929
"'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",6,2930
"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",5,2931
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",6,2932
Right.,6,533
"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",6,2933
"No, I know. Me neither.",6,2934
I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,6,2935
I'm doing the best I can.,6,630
I know that Augie. Really I do.,5,2936
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",5,2937
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,6,2199
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",0,2938
"For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",3,2939
Yeah?,5,636
Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,3,2940
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",6,2941
"Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",3,2942
"Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",6,2943
I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,5,2944
"Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.",5,2945
What have we got here?,5,2946
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",6,1457
It's not champagne.,6,647
"Well, I guess we don't need glasses.",6,2947
You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?,3,2948
No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all.,6,2949
"Augie, I'm sorry.",0,651
"Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.",6,2950
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Hmm.,6,131
Good God.,5,654
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
"Well, nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,2951
Must be them then.,6,1464
What are we going to do?,5,2952
"We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",6,2953
Now and always sweet.,6,1467
I don't care then.,6,662
It's bound to come sooner or later.,6,2954
Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.,5,2955
Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.,4,2956
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,5,2220
Behave exquisitely.,6,2221
With the most perfect poise.,6,2957
"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",6,2958
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",4,2959
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,4,2225
Oh darling don't say that.,6,2960
It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke.,6,2961
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?,6,2962
Yes. Meaning just that.,6,2963
What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?,5,2964
Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,3,2965
"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",3,2966
Who's they?,5,680
"All those futile moralists, who try to make life unbearable, laugh at them, be flippant. Laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths",6,2967
flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.,6,2968
"Well, if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.",1,2969
"Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.",1,2970
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",6,2239
"No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",0,2971
"Oh dear, should we like that?",5,689
Depends on how well we play it.,6,2972
"Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",6,2973
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",6,2974
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",3,693
"No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",6,2975
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",3,2247
So is everyone else in the long run.,6,2248
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.",1,2976
Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,6,2977
"Elliot, worms don't pop.",6,2978
"I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome, and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word, as long as you love me best.",3,2979
"Thank you dear, the same applies you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",3,2980
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,2254
Which particular one?,6,703
"The one when you bought that little, painted, wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.",6,2981
"Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.",6,2982
"Horrible thing, I hated it.",6,2983
I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,6,2984
How long did that row last?,6,709
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,2985
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,6,2261
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",6,713
That was the first time you ever hit me.,5,2262
I didn't hit you very hard.,6,2263
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,6,2986
I'll never forget his face.,6,2987
"Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.",6,2988
We were very much younger then.,6,722
And very much sillier.,1,723
As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,6,2989
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
You knew there was nothing in that.,5,2990
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,6,1534
"Presents, just a trivial little broach.",6,2991
"Yes, I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,2992
No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,6,2993
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
"No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",3,2994
"You must admit he was in love with you, wasn't he?",6,2995
"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",6,2274
You let him kiss you; you said you did.,6,2996
What of it?,5,732
What of it?,5,732
"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",1,2997
What about me?,4,734
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.",6,2998
That's a nice point of view I must say.,1,1544
I'm bored of this conversation.,0,2999
"Yes, me too, bored stiff. You want some Brandy?",6,3000
No thanks.,6,3001
I have a little I think.,6,3002
I don't see why you want any you've already had two glasses.,5,3003
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",6,3004
It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,3005
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,6,2286
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",6,2287
You needn't be so grand just because don't happen want any yourself right now.,6,3006
Don't be so stupid.,3,2289
"Really, Amanda.",5,748
What?,5,328
Nothing.,6,749
No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,6,3007
"Going out somewhere, dear?",6,3008
It's a woman's job to allure the man,6,3009
That reply has broken my heart.,0,752
"watch me a minute, will you?",6,3010
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",6,2293
"Oh, no it isn't.",6,3011
Yes it is.,6,625
Be quiet.,6,3012
It's a pity you didn't have any more Brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable.,6,3013
It doesn't seem to work such wonders with you.,6,3014
"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",3,2298
Adders don't snap they sting.,3,3015
Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,3,3016
They sting.,3,1567
They snap.,3,2300
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,3,3017
"Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",6,3018
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",6,1569
I imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then.,6,3019
Mind your own business.,6,766
What riotous time you must have had.,3,3020
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.",1,3021
You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.,3,3022
I am not in the least drunk.,6,3023
"I imagine, as I may have already mentioned, I've had three minute liquor glasses of Brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",6,3024
On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy.,6,3025
"Oh very interesting. How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine?",5,3026
Oh be quiet.,0,3027
"We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",3,3028
"Not very funny my dear, you better have some more Brandy.",5,3029
All right. I will.,6,3030
Better turn that off I think.,6,3031
Why?,5,343
Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,3,2315
There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio.,6,3032
There are people downstairs I suppose?,5,2317
They're away in Tunis.,6,2318
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,6,2319
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
I'll do no such thing.,3,2320
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",6,2321
Turn it off it's driving me mad.,3,3033
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,3,3034
Turn it off.,6,787
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,3,3035
"Amanda, listen. Listen.",6,3036
"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",4,3037
Very amusing indeed.,1,3038
"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",3,3039
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",6,3040
"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",6,3041
You're not going like this.,6,794
Oh yes I am.,6,3042
You're not.,6,796
"Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",3,3043
Shut up.,3,774
Shut up.,3,774
I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,3,3044
You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,3,3045
"God, finally I got to the line, the front of the line. I've been waiting there for like half an hour.",5,3046
[BREATHING] It's so hot in here. Hoo.,6,3047
Yeah.,6,2
"Oh, um-",6,3048
What's wrong?,3,3049
"You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.",6,3050
"No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line.",6,3051
Who?,5,3052
I don't know. Some lady. Sonya or something.,6,3053
She- she probably doesn't even work here.,6,3054
"Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there..",6,3055
All right  Uh-,6,3056
and she told me to come over here and she said to fill out everything on the application and I did that.,6,3057
It's not right.,6,3058
"Look, I-- No, no, no, I--you don't understand. I have to go back to work.",3,3059
You just take--all right.,6,3060
"Well, you didn't fill this paper at work out right and it's going to take another fifteen minutes to do it and look at how long the line we got here so just-",6,3061
I am not-,6,3062
"okay, just go back and fill it out real quick and I'm sorry, you have to get back in line and wait. I can't let you cut.",6,3063
But you don't understand. I cannot get back in line because I have to go back to work. I will get fired if I don't leave here.,3,3064
"Well, maybe you should have got here earlier than so you had a lot of time to do this.",6,3065
But I was at work and the lady told me to come and work it and to stand in the line.,6,3066
I don't know who this lady is.,5,3067
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"How's it going, babe?",6,3068
Yeah?,5,636
All right.,6,1365
Good.,6,948
"Hey listen,eh- I've been wanting to talk to you. I have something to tell you. How's Amy doing?",6,3069
She's doing fine. She just took her first steps today actually. I videotaped it for you so you can watch it.,6,3070
yeah.,6,3071
oh.,6,3072
"I really want to say that. Well I, so, you know, at the center department they called me in and I talked to-",1,3073
"Oh, yeah? What did they say?",5,3074
Well umm- actually they--I was promoted.,5,3075
"Oh, wow. That's great.",5,3076
And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.,6,3077
"And uh - seeing as I was uh- promoted and head of the department now, and so- well, they asked me to go.",6,3078
yeah.,6,3071
when?,5,3079
It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.,6,3080
What? You can't do that. Three weeks?,5,3081
yeah,6,3082
"Well, I'm leaving in three weeks, but-- Yeah.",0,3083
"God, we're supposed to take a look at a house next week.",5,3084
Maybe we can still do that,6,3085
"I can't- No, I can't do this alone.",4,3086
"Yeah, and uh--",6,3087
Amy's starting school in a month.,6,3088
"I know, but look, I have to take this. I mean, if I don't, I mean, I could get fired.",3,3089
And we know you need-we need the money. We couldn't even- purchase a house if I didn't take this.,6,3090
God.,5,3091
You know what happened to my cousin. She went and she never came back.,3,3092
"Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.",6,3093
But it- it is for a year.,6,3094
Oh,6,3095
"Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.",0,3096
I can't-,0,3097
"You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.",0,3098
You remember the last time you went? You know how hard it was for me? Now we have a kid.,6,3099
"But you're so good with her. You know, she knows you better than she knows me 'cause I'm at work every day.",6,3100
I have to work.,0,3101
[BREATHING],6,428
"Babe, I love you.",1,3102
You can't leave your daughter alone like this.,3,3103
"But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.",6,3104
It's going to be okay.,6,3105
You can't postpone it?,3,3106
"No, I have to go.",0,3107
"Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.",6,3108
I don't know if I can handle you going another year.,6,3109
What do you mean?,5,953
I don't know if I- if I could take it.,4,3110
"Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--",6,3111
I can't be that strong. A whole year.,6,3112
"me, oh my god.",5,3113
"But we can work, you know, we--you can write me and we could see pictures",6,3114
What if you don't come back?,3,3115
"and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--",6,3116
I will come back.,6,3117
"What am I supposed--oh, one out of five people aren't coming back.",5,3118
It doesn't look very good.,0,3119
I can do it. I'm going to do it. And I'll be back safe and sound and-,6,3120
we'll have all the money that we ever needed.,6,3121
And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.,3,3122
I don't want the money. I want-you here,3,3123
"we'll get money, all right? You don't need the job, all right?",3,3124
If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.,4,3125
It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.,0,3126
How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?,5,3127
"Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.",6,3128
"How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.",4,3129
Don't do that to me.,4,3130
"It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't.",0,3131
I'm not thinking about just me; I'm thinking about our child.,6,3132
I know.,6,39
"I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.",5,3133
"I'm sorry, babe.",0,3134
I'm so sorry.,0,3135
"All right, then.",6,3136
"Oh, my God, look at that. Huh-oh, how many carats is that?",5,3137
"I know. [LAUGHTER]. Dude, I don't know. It's- Probably. It's huge. I don't even know how to like wear it. My hand is like going down like really low. I can't believe it.",5,3138
Like eighteen? [LAUGHTER],5,3139
"Oh, Jesus.",5,3140
Is it-,6,3141
"I- Yeah, it's-",6,3142
So how did he do it?,5,3143
"Oh, man. So I was--okay, so we went to go see this show on Broadway, right? And it was The wed- the wed- The Lousy Chaperone. Have you seen that one?",1,3144

"Yeah, The Lousy Chaperone. [LAUGHTER] Uh huh.",6,3146
"Right. Right. Right. So, and there's like a whole like wedding scene in it. All right, not the--Drowsy, Drowsy [LAUGHTER] --not the Lousy. [LAUGHTER]. Um - So Drowsy. So I go to see this Drowsy Chaperone. And uh-",6,3147
[LAUGHTER] Uh- Drowsy.,6,3148
"at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and",5,3149
"Joe's gone. -where did he go, you know?",5,3150
Uh huh. Oh-,6,3151
"And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-",5,3152
he comes up onstage-- And the entire cast everyone just like,5,3153
oh-,5,3154
goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.,5,3155
"Oh, my God.",5,3156
"And I'm like freaking out. I'm like what the hell's going on, you know. I don't know what's going on. And so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone-",5,3157
and he just starts doing like this little spiel about me and like,6,3158
"he asked me to marry him, like- onstage. I was like, I couldn't believe--and I had to walk up there and I was, like I think I tripped or something.",5,3159
Are you kidding me?,5,864
"Wha- What'd you say? You said yes, right? [LAUGHTER]",5,3160
"Yeah, I said yes, but I, yeah, I mean,",6,3161
"I don't know- it just like took me, took me by surprise.",5,3162
He scored points.,6,3163
Did you get a standing ovation?,5,3164
"Oh, yeah. Everyone--yeah. And people--friends of ours were in the audience, I didn't know about, like family members.",6,3165
Yeah. It was great.,1,3166
Are you serious?,5,3167
"It was--I cried,",0,3168
"No, you deserve to cry. I mean, tears of happiness.",6,3169
"like a loser, I cried.",0,3170
"But, I don't know, I--it's so weird to think I'm marrying somebody 'cause I feel so young, you know?",6,3171
So where- where- where is this--have you talked about where it's going to be?,5,3172
No. No plans. or any- and probably,0,3173
"like I think I want to get married--I want to have two weddings. One here, then one in Europe.",0,3174
Hawaii? No.,6,3175
No. Hawaii's for honeymoons. But uh--,6,3176
Oh. Like Paris? On the Eiffel Tower?,5,3177
"Oh, maybe. I don't know. I've been there so many times. I think it's--we're going to get married in Spain and then we're going to get married here.",6,3178
He's rich enough. Maybe you can rent out the Eiffel Tower for your--,6,3179
"Oh, Jesus.",5,3140
That's awesome. [LAUGHTER] Marriage.,1,3180
Yeah. I'm so excited. [LAUGHTER].,1,3181
"I don't know, Brian, if they uh--it's been three years.",6,3182
"Hey, you just got to keep on going.",6,3183
"No, I don't know, I--maybe this isn't for me. You know, maybe this isn't the right business for me.",6,3184
"No, don't think like that.",6,3185
"I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything.",6,3186
I have no money behind me. Nothing. I'm twenty five and--,0,3187
Russel Crowe wasn't forty until he got his big stuff.,6,3188
"If you really want to do it-I mean,",6,3189
So I'll have to wait twenty five years-,6,3190
you got to do.,0,3191
"-just going and auditioning and auditioning and rejection after refection, it's like--",6,3192
You could. You could. We just--,6,3193
we're just pooling our funds together.,6,3194
"I know, I just don't know if I can handle it. I mean, you're helping me so much financially it's like I can't survive on my own without you. I don't like that.",6,3195
You don't owe me anything.,3,3196
I feel like I'm not doing anything. Like I'm not giving anything into this world.,6,3197
"You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared.",6,3198
"Yeah, but what if I never make it? What if I studied all my life, this theatre, this acting, and I'm never going to get anywhere. I'm never going to be able to have a job.",4,3199
"Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that.",5,3200
Time is passing by. Every year it's,6,3201
a part left than I can do.,0,3202
"You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five.",6,3203
Really?,5,123
Yeah.,6,2
"I don't know, I just [BREATHING] I get frustrated",3,3204
What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.,3,3205
That's the thing. I don't know. I don't know anything.,6,3206
Law school? Maybe.,6,3207
"I don't know. I don't know anything other than this, though, is the problem. This is my life. This is what I built everything about, you know.",6,3208
See? So you can't just quit now.,3,3209
"I mean, I could go to law school, but I'm just not passionate about it, you know? Like I'm not--it doesn't drive me, it doesn't motivate me. I--",3,3210
Have you been going to auditions and stuff?,6,3211
"Yeah. I mean, I get a call-back and stuff, but-",6,3212
"I just, I need a break. I need something to break me out.",0,3213
How's the job? Still waiting tables at Denny's?,5,3214
Yeah. Unfortunately.,0,3215
"Yeah, so I go to--get an education for four years and I'm waiting tables at Denny's.",6,3216
"Well, they tip well.",6,3217
[BREATHING] Brian-,4,3218
it's not funny. I just don't know what I'm going to do.,5,3219
Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.,6,3220
"Yeah, I guess I could.",6,3221
"Go back to school. You know? Another three more years, get your master's.",6,3222
Yeah,6,1856
"Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough.",5,3223
Thanks.,6,1839
[LAUGHTER],6,452
[BREATHING],6,428
"Look sir, I've been waiting for about an hour and my luggage still hasn't come. What's going on?",5,3224
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Rosenkrantz, but uh- I don't know what to tell you.",0,3225
"What do you mean, you don't know what to tell me? I have two luggage that I've been coming--they're coming--from France and I need them here. I'm home now. I need to go start working.",3,3226
Did you- Did you check with the lost and found?,5,3227
"Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?",5,3228
I had my luggage transferred here from Paris to L.A. and now I'm here and I need to be working and I have all my stuff in there.,6,3229
"Maybe it got lost. Did you think about that, mom?",5,3230
"Well, that's what I'm asking you. What--I don't know what happened to it.",5,3231
"Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.",6,3232
"Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?",5,3233
"No, I mean, maybe in the little--going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there.",6,3234
Okay. All I know is that I am supposed to have my language here right now. Right now. And it's not there. And you're supposed to help me because you work at the airport. So give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is.,3,3235
Okay. What can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so-- Wherever you stay,6,3236
"What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.",6,3237
Not to mention I have my work in there.,6,3238
"Well, I'll have you fill out some paperwork and see if you can get started on something.",6,3239
"And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?",4,3240
"You know, we'll file a complaint and we could possibly, you know, replace some of the things. I think-",6,3241
and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.,6,3242
Fifteen percent?,5,3243
Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.,6,3244
What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.,5,3245
"Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that?",5,3246
"No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris.",6,3247
"Sir, why are you laughing at me? This isn't funny.",5,3248
"I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.",6,3249
"Well I'm sorry, if I--no, it's not stupid. You are supposed to have my luggage.",0,3250
Did you lock- Did you lock it even? You probably didn't even lock it.,5,3251
"No, they said I couldn't lock it.",6,3252
"[LAUGHTER], That's what they say.",6,3253
Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.,4,3254
"Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me.",3,3255

It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-,6,3261
"he had cancer, you know?",5,3262
"Mmm, Hmm.",6,3263
"They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad.",0,3264
"Turned around for the worst, you know.",6,3265
"I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.",5,3266
He was amazing.,5,3267
I loved that boy.,1,3268
"We did everything together, you know.",6,3269
"It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.",0,3270
He's so young. It seems so--,6,3271
so wrong in so many ways.,3,3272
"His poor parents. You know, it's their only son.",6,3273
yeah.,6,3071
"Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease.",6,3274

Yeah.,6,2
And he just got that baseball scholarship.,6,3276
"I know. He was, he had so much going for him.",5,3277
"So handsome, so young, so gifted.",6,3278
So talented.,6,3279
"Such a sweet person, you know?",1,3280
How's his parents doing?,6,3281
Not very good.,0,3282
"Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.",5,3283
"It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?",6,3284
Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.,6,3285
"You guys were pretty close, weren't you?",5,3286
"He was like, he was like my brother, you know.",6,3287
He was my brother.,6,3288
"Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.",6,3289
"You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and-",6,3290

"Yeah. God, I loved that kid.",1,3300
"So nice, so positive.",1,3301

I don't know.,5,257
"I never told him, I love you, but-",1,3304
I loved him so much.,1,3305

"No, we don't just give you things.  We're- we're-",6,3405
we compensating you for all your-,0,3406
So you take things from me and you expect me just to wait around.,6,3407
"No no, we're not taking anything from you sir.  This is- This is unbeknownst to us.  The problem had just happened.",4,3408
The satellite-is down in your area.,5,3409
"Okay, so you think you're going to-  -get me back some minutes, and that's going to make up for three days of business that I lost?  Okay, great.",6,3410
"No, three days, sir.  It's not three days. It's- It's only been about a day now. Let's not exaggerate.",6,3411
"No, it's been--three days.",6,3412
"Fine, it's been a day.  Okay?",6,3413
Three days?,5,3414
A day?,5,3415
A day's worth of business.  You know how much I make in a day?,6,3416
"I don't know, sir.",6,3417
About three million dollars.,6,3418
"Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-",0,3419
"So, you're going to give me back ten dollars worth of minutes--",6,3420
#NAME?,1,1025
"Well, ten hours worth of minutes--",6,3421
is what's going to happen.,5,3422
"Ten hours? So, basically, a day's worth of minutes which I pay forty dollars a month from it.",6,3423
Yeah.,6,2
"Sir,",6,3424
So you're giving me a dollar back.,6,3425
"what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-",6,3426
"Oh, my God.",5,3156
and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.,6,3427
Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.,1,3428
What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,6,3429
He saw it.,6,318
"What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed.",5,3430
He was out there when it happened.,5,3431
When?,5,321
"Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.",4,3432
What was he doing out at four in the morning?,5,3433
I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,6,3434
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",6,3435
"He cried hard, huh?",6,3436
I could hear it right through the floor.,4,3437
What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again.,6,3438
I guess he is.,6,325
"Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",5,3439
What's the meaning in that?,6,3440
I don't know.,5,257
"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",4,3441
"Well, what do you mean? What?",5,3442
Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,6,3443
"What do you mean, dishonest?",3,3444
You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,6,3445
"What, you're going to argue with him?",3,3446
"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.",6,3447
You can't tell him that.,5,3448
We got to tell him that.,6,3449
We can't. It just won't work.,0,3450
"You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.",6,3451
They do come back.,6,3452
"I know, but he doesn't know that.",5,3453
Three years has been a long time.,6,3454
"All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.",6,3455
"It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",6,3456
"All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.",3,3457
What?,5,328
"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",6,3458
Why?,5,343
You know.,6,344
"Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story?",6,3459
I want to ask her to marry me.,0,3460
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",6,1195
"Come on, you know that's not only my business.",3,3461
"Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.",3,3462
So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,6,3463
"Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.",6,3464
"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",5,3465
"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",3,3466
God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.,6,3467
"Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.",6,3468
And she-she's Larry's girl.,6,3469
"No, she is not Larry's girl.",6,3470
"Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.",6,3471
"If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go.",6,3472
"'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?",3,3473
"Oh, I don't know.",5,3474
What do you want from me?,3,3475
"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",0,3476
You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,6,3477
To hell with that.,3,361
There's nothing wrong with it.,6,3478
I didn't ask Annie yet.,6,3479
You didn't ask her yet?,5,3480
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father?",5,3481
Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,6,3482
"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",6,3483
"Mom, don't avoid me.",4,3484
"You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.",6,3485
So what? I'm not fast with women.,5,3486
I don't understand why it has to be her.,5,3487
Because it is.,6,370
"That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.",6,3488
I just-,6,3489
"I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.",5,3490
It just is. I-,6,3491
"I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",6,3492
"No, I don't want a diagram.",6,3493
"He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?",6,3494
"Okay. All right, then.",6,3495
"Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.",6,3496
"No, I've given it three years of thought.",6,3497
And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,6,3498
But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,6,3499
What the hell is this?,3,383
I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,6,3500
You're crazy.,3,3501
I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.,0,3502
You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?,3,3503
The business. The business doesn't inspire me.,6,3504
"Oh, you have to be inspired.",6,3505
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,1,3506
"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",5,3507
"Now, where do I find it?",5,3508
Tell me something.,6,3509
You'd leave that business.,3,3510
Yes. On this I would.,6,3511
You can't do that.,3,3512
Then help me stay here.,6,395
"All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.",3,3513
Okay. Just-,6,3514
"We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.",6,3515
"Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?",6,3516
I'm going to.,6,3517
You just can't talk like that.,6,3518
I am thinking like that.,6,1235
"I don't know you, do I?",5,3519
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",6,2789
Yeah. I can see that.,6,3520
Why did you invite her here?,5,3521
Why? Does that bother you?,3,3522
She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,6,3523
"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",6,3524
You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,6,3525
"What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do.",3,3526
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,5,411
It's got that about it.,6,412
"Well, so what?",3,2021
"What's going on here, Joe?",5,2022
"Listen, kid-",6,3527
She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,6,3528
You can't read her mind.,6,417
Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.,5,3529
"I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no.",6,3530
She's waited.,6,3531
How do you know why she's waited?,5,2026
"Because she thinks like me, that's why.",6,3532
"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",6,3533
"I think again, that I'm-I'm right.",6,3534
"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",1,3535
"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",4,3536
Calm yourself.,6,429
Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.,3,3537
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",3,3538
"Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.",5,3539
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,6,2809
"You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone.",4,3540
Okay. Just calm yourself.,6,3541
"No, you've got to believe.",5,3542
"Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe.",5,3543
"Why me, above all?",5,3544
Huh?,5,3545
Why me above all?,5,3546
You got to keep believing.,6,3547
"Look at you, you're shaking.",4,433
I can't help it.,0,434
What have I got to hide?,6,3548
"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",3,3549
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,6,3550
"Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?",6,3551
"No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.",6,3552
It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.,1,3553
You're not sorry you came?,5,1269
No. I'm not sorry. It's-,0,3554
I can't stay.,0,3555
Why not?,6,179
"Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].",6,3556
Well-,6,3557
"Look,",3,3558
"you've been acting kind of, well, you know.",6,3559
What?,5,328
"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",6,3560
"Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.",6,3561
"Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.",6,3562
Yeah.,6,2
How did you know?,5,3563
"Yeah, they would. Especially your mom.",6,3564
"Well, uh- would you want to?",5,3565
"I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",6,3566
"Well, I mean,",6,3567
"Oh, Annie.",0,3568
"from her opinion, why else would I come here?",3,3569
"Annie, I love you.",1,3570
I love you a great deal.,1,1281
I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.,1,3571
"Well, I guess that's why I came.",6,3572
"I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.",6,3573
I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.,6,3574
"I've been ready for a long, long time.",6,3575
Then he's gone forever. You're sure?,5,3576
Look,6,3577
I was almost married two years ago.,1,3578
Why didn't you?,5,460
'Cause you started to write me.,3,3579
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Every day since.,6,463
Why didn't you let me know?,3,464
"Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say?",5,3580
You always can be so ambiguous.,6,3581
"Give me a kiss, Annie.",6,3582
Give me-,6,3583
"[LAUGHTER]. God, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",5,3584
I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,5,3585
We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,1,3586
"Not like that, you're not.",6,3587
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",6,3588
What is it?,5,3589
Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,0,3590
No. What is it? Is it your mother?,5,3591
"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",6,3592
"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",6,3593
"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",6,3594
You should tell me.,6,3595
I don't know where to start.,4,3596
"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",6,3597
You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,6,3598
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
"Well, I lost them.",0,2080
How many?,5,487
Just about all.,6,2081
Geez.,6,3599
It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,6,3600
"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",6,3601
"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",6,3602
"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",5,3603
"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",6,3604
And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,1,3605
And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,5,3606
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,3,3607
"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",6,3608
"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",6,3609
And I didn't want to take any of it.,6,3610
And I guess that included you.,6,3611
And you still feel that way?,6,3612
"I want you now, Annie.",6,3613
"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",6,3614
"I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.",6,3615
"Annie,",6,3616
"Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.",1,3617
What am I going to do with a fortune?,6,3618
"Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?",5,3619
Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.,0,3620
"You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?",6,3621
Fine.,3,507
"Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.",5,3622
"Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?",5,3623
"Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.",5,3624
What flashlight?,5,513
"Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",5,3625
That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.,6,3626
"Oh, well, sure.",6,3627
"I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",5,3628
"No, of course. Yours and mine. Our flashlight. Yours and mine. Mi flashlight is su flashlight. Naturally.",6,3629
We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.,5,3630
I hope the moon stays out.,6,3631
"Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?",5,3632
Yes.,6,192
Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?,3,3633
"We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.",5,3634
"You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",5,3635
I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].,5,3636
I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.,5,3637
I'm cold.,0,528
Do you want my jacket?,6,529
"It's past eleven, let's go home.",6,3638
What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,5,3639
There is no point in coming down here.,6,2119
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
"Yeah, that's my point too.",6,3640
"Well, so let's go.",6,3641
"No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.",6,3642
"I mean, don't you want to see it?",3,3643
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I don't know. I just don't.,6,3644
"Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.",6,3645
Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,6,3646
Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.,6,3647
"I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.",6,3648
"I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.",5,3649
"Yeah, they do.",6,1360
"Oh, God, Augie.",5,3650
"What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.",6,3651
"There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested.",5,3652
"I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me.",6,3653
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.,5,3654
And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.,5,3655
"Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.",6,3656
We weren't in a good spot.,0,2134
"No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.",5,3657
"We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-",6,3658
"no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it?",6,3659
"I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",6,3660
Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.,5,3661
"And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",6,3662
"You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.",6,3663
"its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.",4,3664
"They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here",6,3665
"where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.",5,3666
"Yeah, that's the wind.",6,3667
So what do you think?,6,566
About what?,5,567
About what I just said.,6,3668
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
So what do you think?,6,566
About what?,5,567
About what I was just saying.,6,3669
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,3670
"It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach.",1,3671
"Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.",6,3672
Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now.,1,3673
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
I don't care. It's still fish to me.,6,3674
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",6,3675
"Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",3,3676
"Okay, then what's bugging you?",3,3677
"Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.",6,3678
"There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.",6,3679
It's not like that.,6,3680
We're not seeing the grunions?,5,3681
"Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come.",6,3682
We missed them twice. That's not ever.,6,3683
Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.,6,3684
We'll see them this time.,6,3685
"No, we won't.",6,3686
"It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?",6,3687
Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,6,3688
"God, I thought you wanted to see it.",5,3689
I do.,6,3690
"Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.",6,3691
It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.,6,3692
"For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.",6,3693
"I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.",6,3694
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.",1,3695
"And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-",6,3696
Do you remember the last time we came here?,6,3697
We thought I was pregnant.,4,3698
You brought a bottle of champagne.,6,3699
We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.,6,3700
And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.,6,3701
"Oh, that moment-that was it.",5,3702
"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",1,3703
Wait a minute. I got it.,6,3704
Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,4,3705
"It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.",6,3706
"You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?",6,3707
I don't want to remember something.,6,3708
Hope for some things.,6,3709
"Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?",6,3710
No.,6,136
Do you want me to get some champagne?,3,3711
No.,6,136
Take off our shoes?,5,2182
"No, no.",6,202
What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,5,3712
No.,6,136
Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?,5,3713
No.,6,136
No.,6,136
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
A new carpet? A poodle?,5,3714
"A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",3,3715
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,6,3716
"Jesus, welcome to the human race.",6,3717
Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?,5,3718
"No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.",1,3719
"You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.",3,3720
This what? What is this? This is nothing.,5,3721
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",6,3722
Right.,6,533
Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,6,3723
"No, I know. Me neither.",6,2934
"I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but",6,3724
it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,6,3725
"Well, I'm doing the best I can.",6,3726
"I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.",0,3727
"Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.",6,3728
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.",0,3729
"Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.",6,3730
Yeah?,5,636
"God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.",6,3731
"Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.",6,3732
"Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.",6,3733
"Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.",6,3734
I noticed that. It's beautiful.,1,3735
You can see right over the water.,6,3736
"God, big old white moon.",5,3737
Look what we got here.,5,1456
You brought refreshments?,5,3738
It's not champagne.,6,647
At least we won't need glasses.,6,3739
Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?,0,3740
So I was thinking you might be right.,6,3741
Maybe this is the right place after all.,6,3742
"I'm sorry, Augie.",0,3743
Shh.,6,3744
If we're very quiet the fish might come.,4,3745
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Oh.,6,103
[BREATHING],6,428
Good God.,5,654
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
"I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,3746
It must be them then.,6,658
What are we to do?,6,3747
"We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.",6,3748
"Yes. Now and always, sweet.",6,3749
Then I don't care.,3,3750
It was bound to come sooner or later.,6,2217
"Hello? Hello? What? Ugh, wrong number.",6,3751
"[LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine.",4,3752
"things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",4,3753
"Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke.",6,3754
"Ooh darling, don't say that.",6,3755
"You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",6,3756
"Yes, meaning just that.",6,2229
What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?,6,3757
Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,3,2965
"[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.",6,3758
Who's they?,5,680
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,6,3759
"Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too.",6,3760
"Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.",1,3761
"So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",3,3762
Who knows?,6,686
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,3,687
No. The fire will fade along with our passion.,0,3763
"Oh dear, well, shall we want that?",6,3764
Depends on how well we play it.,6,2972
"Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?",6,3765
"Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might.",6,3766
"Well, that's serious enough.",0,3767
"No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.",6,3768
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",3,2247
So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,0,3769
"Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",1,3770
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",6,2251
"I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",3,3771
"Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.",3,3772
Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,3773
Which particular one?,6,703
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,6,3774
Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.,6,3775
Horrible little thing. I hated it.,6,3776
I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,6,3777
How long did that row last?,6,709
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,6,3778
"Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].",6,3779
yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.,5,3780
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",6,713
The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER],6,3781
I didn't hit you very hard.,6,2263
I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.,5,3782
"Oh, I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].",5,3783
We were very much younger then.,6,722
"Yeah, and very much sillier.",1,3784
"Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,3785
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
You knew there was nothing in that.,5,2990
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,6,1534
Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.,6,3786
I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,6,3787
Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.,6,3788
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
"No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination.",6,3789
You must admit that he was in love with you.,1,3790
"Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.",0,3791
You let him kiss you. You said so.,6,3792
"Well, what of it?",3,731
What of it?,5,732
"Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.",6,3793
What about me?,4,734
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it.",6,3794
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",1,736
"Well, it's true.",6,3795
Are you bored with this conversation?,6,3796
"I definitely, most definitely am.",6,3797
So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?,0,3798
"No, thanks.",6,2281
"I'll have a little, I think.",6,740
I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,5,3799
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.",6,3800
I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.,5,3801
"Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on.",5,3802
It's become a habit with you.,6,745
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.,6,3803
Don't be so stupid.,3,2289
"Really, Amanda.",5,748
What?,5,328
Nothing.,6,749
"Going somewhere, dear?",5,3804
No. Just making myself fascinating for you.,6,3805
That reply has broken my heart.,0,752
"It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",6,3806
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",6,2293
"No, it isn't.",6,2294
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"No, it's not. I don't care.",6,3807
It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,6,3808
"Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?",5,3809
"Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",3,3810
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",3,760
"Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",3,3811
They sting.,3,1567
They snap.,3,2300
"I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.",3,3812
"Uhh,",6,3813
did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,6,3814
"Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.",6,3815
"I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",6,3816
Mind your business.,6,3817
You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,1,3818
You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,3,3819
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,6,3820
You've always had a weak head.,6,769
"Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.",6,3821
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,771
"Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.",6,3822
Do shut up. Shut up.,3,3823
I don't want to talk about this anymore.,6,3824
You better turn that off.,6,3825
Why?,5,343
It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,3,3826
There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,6,3827
"Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.",6,3828
They're away in Tunis.,6,2318
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,6,2319
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
"No, I will do no such thing.",3,3829
Turn it on.,6,3830
No.,6,136
You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.,6,3831
Turn it off.,6,787
I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,3,3832
"Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-",1,3833
"Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",4,3834
Very amusing indeed.,1,3038
"Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",3,3835
"You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.",6,3836
This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.,6,3837
"No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.",6,3838
"Oh, yes I am.",6,3839
"Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.",3,3840
"Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.",3,3841
"I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",6,3842
"Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.",6,3843
"Hey listen here missy, I've been in this line for an hour and now I'm finally here.  So you're going to take my application.",1,3844
Is that a demand sir?,6,3845
It's not a demand it's a request.  Will you just take it?  Come on.,6,3846
I must see it before I just take it.,6,3847
Oh.  Look at it.,5,3848
"Sir, you completely filled this out wrong.",3,3849
No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.,6,3850
What?,5,328
What are you talking about?  It says fill out that part.,5,3851
"No, no, no, no, no.  You're going to have to go back over on the other side-- --second door, up the stairs...",4,3852
Okay.,6,185
Oh my God. Can you just transfer it yourself?,5,3853
No I can't just transfer it myself sir.  You got to do this.  Everyone else is doing the same thing.,6,3854
You don't know! you can't write?  You don't know how to write?,5,3855
Excuse me sir?,3,3856
What's wrong with you people?  God.,5,3857
I think you're being a little condescending.,6,3858
You need to go back over there and fill it out again.,6,3859
The information is on there.  Here I'll just fill it out right here.,6,3860
"No, no, no, because there are other people in line.  You have to go get a complete new application.",6,3861
"This will take like a minute, okay? Jesus.",6,3862
"No, no, no. Sir,you need to get out of the line--",4,3863
I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying right here.,0,3864
"Well I'm going to have to call- security because sir, you- there are hundreds of people waiting in line at this D.M.V.-- --We're closing in about half an hour...",5,3865
"Hey,uh-- Well that's too bad cause I'm getting my license right now.",0,3866
"You will get your license, sir, you have to go fill out-- --another copy...excuse me?",6,3867
Give me my--,3,3868
"Hey, no, give me that back.",3,3869
No.  Now I'm going to take this from you because you are obviously misleading,6,3870
-- No.  I'm not waiting...I'm not coming back again.  I don't have time to come back five days.,0,3871
No.  You couldn't go get another one.,0,3872
Well then you won't have a license will you?,6,3873
I'll have a license.,6,3874
Well not from this department you won't.,6,3875
Yes I will.  I'll have this [GARBAGE],6,3876
Sir-,6,3877
just as I want.  Ugh.,0,3878
Sir?  I'm going to ask you one more time and then I'm going to call my supervisor,6,3879
who will proceed to call-- security if you can't remove yourself--,6,3880
Fine.  Call your supervisor.  Ask supervisor over,3,3881
and I'll tell her how you've been behaving.,6,3882
Really?,5,123
How would you like that hmm?,6,3883
"She's not actually in the building.  She's only on the phone. Sir, please leave this line immediately.",6,3884
"Oh, okay.  Wow.",5,3885
No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here-- I am filling out right now okay just calm down. I'm filling out right now-- Just take the god damn piece of paper.,6,3886
Okay.  I'm going to call security. Security!,3,3887
"I have it.  I'm taking it.  Doesn't mean I'm going to do anything with it.--Get out of my line!  This is my line.  Get out.  All these people--Sir, you are causing a mob in this department.",3,3888
Okey This is a new one.  Take the new one.,5,3889
Do you own the D.M.V.?,6,3890
I'm sorry she's--these people they just want to get their license--,0,3891
"No, You cannot get your license.  You filled out the wrong part of the form.",0,3892
What are you talking about?  Just transfer it over.  I filled out the new one.,5,3893
"This entire time you're fighting with me sir, you could've finished the form and already been half way-- No.  Get out.",6,3894
I did finish one.  Take it.,6,3895
What is wrong with you?,3,3896
Hey sweetie.,1,3897
Hey.,6,3898
Um.,6,3899
"How's it- going?  Oh I'm so tired.  Oh, I just woke up. Mmm.",5,3900
What's going on?,5,2577
"Uh, -Um",6,3901
Why the sad face?,0,3902
they need me out there sooner than I thought,5,3903
Where?  Who?  What are you talking about?,5,3904
They want to deploy me next week.,6,3905
Next week?,6,3906
Overseas?,6,3907
For--,6,3908
For how long this time?,6,3909
They said anywhere from two to three years.,6,3910
What?  What do you mean two to three years?  Don't they know that you have a wife and an expectant child?,5,3911
I told them that but they--,6,3912
Honey--,6,3913
#NAME?,6,1025
You can't.  We need you.  I need you.,4,3914
"I don't want to go but,-",0,3915
I don't care about the money.,6,3916
but they said they'd increase my pay by triple-there promotion.,6,3917
And you're leaving next week so you won't even be here for Anna's birth?,5,3918
No.,6,136
Do this whole thing by myself?,5,3919
Honey you're not going to be by yourself--,6,3920
"We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything.  My whole family's here too.",6,3921
Carry her for nine months and then yes.,6,3922
Honey.,6,3923
It's not the same thing.  It's not like having you here.,6,3924
I can't do this.,0,3925
"You can do it.  Alright?  You can, you can be strong, you can be strong for both of us alright?",6,3926
I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.,0,3927
I don't know what to do.,0,3928
I don't want to - I don't- I don't want to go.,0,3929
What am I supposed to do?,5,3930
You can say no?,3,3931
You know I can't say no.,3,3932
You could.  You really could.  You could-- --get into another line of work.  I could start working after Anna's born?,6,3933
The last guy who said no was fired.,6,3934
I put in fifteen years in this job.,1,3935
I know.,6,39
I'm so close.  Five more years and I retire-,0,3936
and we'll have that happy life.,1,3937
Happiness for me is having you here with me,0,3938
"and watch our child grow, see her take her first steps, her first words.",1,3939
Honey after a year I can be back.,1,3940
You said two years.,6,3941
They want me there two years but I could probably get,0,3942
maybe get some vacation-- --once it quiets down there.,6,3943
A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.,6,3944
I know.  I know.  But they really need some good guys there.,6,3945
What could happen in a year?,5,3946
And this isn't the first time you know?  I mean you always...sending you off to different places and...,5,3947
Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.,6,3948
I don't know if that's how I want to live my life.,6,3949
It's just going to be--it's going to go faster than you think.,6,3950
"Joe I'm serious I don't want to have to have a little girl to tell...asking every day where's daddy, where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away--",4,3951
far away and he won't be here.,0,3952
You tell her-- [BREATHING],3,3953
I'm done.  I can't honey.,0,3954
What do you mean?,5,953
It's over.,0,3955
What?,5,328
Honey I can't do it anymore.,0,3956
Are you kidding me?  No.,5,3957
I need you here.  Anna needs you.,6,3958
So I have--you want me to choose between you guys or my career?,6,3959
yeah.,6,3071

"Just, you got to hang in there.  Can you ask your parents for help or anybody?",6,4077
"No.  I'm not going to...yeah, they'd laugh in my face.",1,4078
"Just for a little bit, you know?  Cause I-I guarantee you're going to find something.  When you find something it's just going to be huge and you're going to get money.",6,4079
No. I got a sixteen hundred on my S.A.T..,6,4080

Yeah.  I--they said Brian you're too smart.  You don't need us.,6,4098
Go out and take over the world by yourself and I'm like what?,6,4099
Well obviously it's not working.  Just cause you got sixteen hundred on your S.A.T. doesn't guarantee you a job.  I mean it should really but--,6,4100

We can party.  We can have fun.,1,4287
This will be like high school but even better.,6,4288
Yeah.  Hopefully it won't be like high school.,6,4289
"Oh man I am so proud of you, that is...how did you get...I mean what did you do?  How did you find out or what...?",5,4290
I-I came home and my mom was like Joe uh-,4,4291
"I have some bad news.  I was like what?  She's like not really you got into U.S.C. and I was like, I was like oh my God.  I was about to tear my own hair out.",5,4292
Oh man.,5,1883
Yeah.  This is so crazy.  I mean I didn't get into any other school but I got into the school I wanted.,6,4293
Did you say yes yet?  I mean have you sent in your answer?,5,4294
Oh my God the first minute I got it I sent it back in.,5,4295
All right.,6,1365
So...,6,1869
"This is so great, you know, because I gone fit on downtown so I'm going to be like right here.  I think I'm going to be living at City Lights downtown.",6,4296
This is so exciting.  This is like a new chapter in our lives.,1,4297
"Yeah, it really is.",6,4298
"We're doing what we want to do, then four years later we're going to be working professionals, making money, sipping martinis every day.",6,4299
God hopefully.,6,4300
Man I'm just so happy for you.  I just--,1,4301
Thank you,6,4302
"Well, I'm happy for you but I'm happy for me cause that means you're going to stay.",1,4303
And tonight my parents want to take me out to sushi and they said I could bring you.,1,4304
Oh great. I would love to go.,1,4305
Yeah.,6,2
Yeah and they said get whatever you want and...,6,4306
Mmmm some miso soup.,6,4307
Some miso soup.  You can get whatever.  You can get a vat full of miso soup.  God.,1,4308
Ah man.,5,4309
This is going to be so great.  I have so many great ideas.,1,4310
Yeah. Did you...I mean do send in like how long after you send in your application did you hear?,5,4311
to start off.,4,4312
"It took them, oh man, it took them like, I mean what it's like April now and any letters that come in April are usually the rejection letters so I was just like...",6,4313
You were like...,6,4314
I was struck.,4,4315
Oh my God.  I am so proud of you.,5,4316
Hello.  This is Viacom Services.  How can I help you?,0,4317
"Hello?  God finally somebody, look, this is ridiculous.  I've been waiting online for like a half an hour now.",5,4318
"I'm sorry ma'am, what can I help you with?",0,4319
"Look my, my phone isn't working.  I don't understand what's going on.  I am trying to call out.  I'm not receiving any calls",0,4320
"and I need assistance with my...not only is my work phone, it's my home phone and look,",6,4321
this is my business.  This is how I make money is through my phone.  It needs to be working.  Can you please help me?,6,4322
Okay.  Can you give me the last four digits of your social security number so I can verify who I'm speaking with?,6,4323
two two six six.,6,4324
Okay.  And your name is?,6,4325
Olivia.,6,4326
Olivia. Um. Okay.  So how long has this problem been?,6,4327
"This has been going on for the past two weeks.  I called every single day.  Nobody is helping me.  You guys tell me the same thing over and over, call again, call again, call again--",6,4328
So what exactly is the problem?,6,4329
"I don't, I don't know what the problem is.  That's what I want you guys to...why is my service not turned on?  And I paid my bills on time.  I don't understand.",5,4330
Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down.  It's been having some trouble the last few weeks--,6,4331
"Okay.  Well that is, that is fine and all.  I don't care.  I really don't care because I want my phone to work that's all.",6,4332
"That is I am paying you guys for service and I'm not getting any service.  I get, I get just dropped calls all the time and now it's completely not working at all.  I can't even call out, nine one one probably wouldn't even work.",5,4333
I understand--we're not-,6,4334
No.  Okay.  We're not charging you for any of these months.  We're going to give you three months free.,6,4335
Well you better.  You better give me a whole freaking new phone that's what you better do.,3,4336
We can give you a new phone--,6,4337
I want a camera phone actually.,6,4338
We can do that.  We can do that.  You just have to sign a one-year contract though with the--,6,4339
"No, no, no...  I'm done with these contract business because this is what can happen.",4,4340
"You sign the contract and then down the line the phone doesn't work and you're stuck, you can't go to a new...no.  No contracts for me.  You give me a new phone.",0,4341
"Besides, it's sort of out of hands at the moment----The whole electrical power outage.",6,4342
I want to talk to a supervisor,4,4343
I would like to talk to your supervisor.  Obviously you're incompetent and don't understand what I'm asking.,0,4344
"Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor.  Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um-",6,4345
What?,5,328
"So you could----speak with me some more, you could call back later on maybe.",6,4346
That's ridiculous.  You know?,6,4347
"No I don't want to call back, you put me on hold for like hours and hours----and it's money, money, money, money and out of my pocket, out of my pocket--",3,4348
I didn't put you on hold.,3,4349
There are a lot of people calling us having problems.  Every phone company is having the same problems ma'am,6,4350
Every phone...every single phone company?,5,4351
"Mmm hmmm.  Mmm hmmm.  The power outages, everything, hurricane Katrina. Everything's really messed up.",5,4352
This is ridiculous.Well what are we supposed to do?  We starve then because I can't use my phone cause,3,4353
"I am a realtor and this is my business.  People are calling me all the time but you know, and I don't have a land line.  I can't afford to have a land line",0,4354
don't you-,6,4355
I'm really sorry ma'am.  There's not----a lot we can do for it.,0,4356
That you better be sorry.,0,4357
Well you're not helping me at all.  God this is so frustrating.,0,4358
"What I can do for you, if you want to make a call right now I could contact you through our computer.  I can call through my phone and you can speak through me.",6,4359
What?  No.  That's way too complicated.  Look--,5,4360
you need to fix my phone.  I don't care what you have to do--,6,4361
I'm sorry it has to do with an electrical power outage and stuff--,0,4362
"Well then go up the freaking pole and fix it like, you need to help me.  You don't understand I'm in dire, dire need of a phone right now.",4,4363
"Well, okay I'm going to give you a free phone card that you can use at any payphone and that's on us. Okay?",6,4364
"Yeah yeah, woman going out in South Central on the payphone at night.  Oh that's real safe.",6,4365
"I'm, I'm sorry you chose to live there um--",0,4366
"No, no, no.  I didn't choose to live here.  I work there.  Okay?  Yeah. work work work",0,4367
okay.,5,4368
Well I'm sure maybe there's a phone at work you could use.,6,4369
"We can't call out.  We can't make out-- line.  I don't work, I work at another office.",0,4370
A law firm.  Thank you very much.,1,4371
All right um--,6,4372
"I work out of my home as a realtor and because I don't have a land line, I need a phone and because of now I don't have one I don't know what to do.  And you're not helping me at all.",0,4373
"In fact, give me your name sir, what's your name again?",6,4374
My name is Sara.,6,4375
Okay.  Sara what?,6,4376
Sara Brown.,6,4377
"Sara Brown.  Sara Brown, um- yeah, I'm going to get off the phone with you. And then I'm going to call back and I'm going to give your supervisor your name because you're obviously incompetent to work here.",6,4378
Okay.,6,185
"You know maam, we record this conversation so anything you say can be proven in a law of court so keep that in mind.",6,4379
"What are you, what are you a police officer now?  You know, like I'm done, I'm over it.  Goodbye and I hope that you lose your job.",5,4380
Hello.,6,4381
Hello?,6,4382
Oh God I finally got...you know how long I've been waiting on line?  You put on hold for like five hours.  Geez.,5,4383
I'm sorry ma'am.  What's the nature of your problem?  But first can I get you to tell me your first and last name?,0,4384
I've already been through this five times with these people.  I've been calling every single day.,6,4385
I know I just need to verify every time.  I'm sorry.,0,4386
Olivia Brown.,6,4387
Alright Ms. Brown what's the nature of your problem?,6,4388
Well my phone isn't working and it hasn't been working for the last five days.,0,4389
Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?,5,4390
"Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry.",0,4391
No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.,6,4392
Okay?  And it [GARBAGE]. My business is failing because my phone isn't working and I don't have a land line and I really can't handle this right now.,0,4393
Okay.,6,185
"Um- well it's probably easy.  Can you any more symptoms either you're not receiving calls----ok, you're not receiving calls, not getting calls.",6,4394
"the symptoms- This [GARBAGE] a doctor's office. I'm not receiving calls...I can't receive- no, it's, it cuts me off--",0,4395
Is the phone turned on?,6,4396
Yes the phone turns on.  No I mean I'm using it not turning on the phone.  Of course it turns on.,6,4397
"Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-",6,4398
No- I don't have a sim card because it's Verizon and you guys don't use sim cards.,6,4399
Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--,6,4400
you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.,6,4401
"Okay no.  Sir, this is the deal.  My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work.  That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it.",6,4402
Okay.  How about this we'll send you a brand new camera phone with palm pilot-- and-,6,4403
I don't know even how to use that stuff it's too complicated.  I just want my flip phone to work----that's all I need,6,4404
"So we'll send it- And we'll give you, how about a free year's service?",6,4405
"Look, I am on the road all the time.  Do you understand how important?  I'm a woman, a single mother by herself working...what?",5,4406
Tell them my name.  My name is Brent Backersen.,6,4407
"Brent Backersen, I am writing this down, Brent Backersen.  Alright.",6,4408
Okay.  Tell them my - my ID number is two one three five.,6,4409
"Tell them that.  You can go in, get a brand new phone, they'll hook you up with service even give you a free three months--",6,4410
"I, I, I don't want a contract. Okay. I don't want any contracts.",3,4411
It will be free.  No contract okay?,6,4412
Really?  No contract?,5,4413
"Go in there, yeah, go in there.  Tell them Brent Backersen sent you.",6,4414
I want the best freaking camera phone there is though.  I want the really good kind--,6,4415
"the top of the line camera phone, game boy, anything you want. For free. And palm pilot.",6,4416
And palm pilot.,6,4417
And charger and accessories and I want a cover that's pink.,6,4418
They might only have orange.,6,4419
no,6,4420
"Okay.  They can figure out pink for you.  So go in there and just tell them that and they'll hook you up with other goodies, stuff like that free service, no contract, no nothing.  Just for being a good customer",6,4421
and battling through with us.,0,4422
"Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,",6,4423
you better promise me.,6,4424
Yes.  You just tell them Brent Backersen sent you.,6,4425
Okay.,6,185
Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.,1,4426
Alright Thanks.,1,4427
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,6,4428
He saw it.,6,318
"What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",5,4429
He was out there when it happened.,5,3431
When?,5,321
About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,4,4430
Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?,5,4431
I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.,0,4432
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,6,4433
He cried hard?,5,1954
I could hear it right through the floor.,4,3437
"God, what was he doing out there anyway?",5,4434
Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.,4,4435
I guess he is.,6,325
"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",5,4436
"I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",4,4437
What?,5,328
Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,6,4438
What do you mean dishonest?,3,330
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,6,4439
What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?,3,4440
"No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.",6,4441
"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",4,4442
That we haven't had any hope for years now?,6,4443
You can't say that to him.,6,335
We got to say it to him.,6,4444
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,5,4445
Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,5,4446
"To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,",6,4447
he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?,5,4448
"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",6,4449
No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,6,4450
Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.,6,4451
"You know why I asked Annie here, right?",6,4452
Why?,5,343
You know.,6,344
Well I have an idea but I don't know.  What's the story?,6,4453
I want to ask her to marry me.,0,3460
Well that's your business Chris.,6,4454
You know it's not just my business.,6,348
"Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",6,4455
Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,6,4456
"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",6,4457
Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,3,4458
Well I'm just saying--,6,4459
You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,6,4460
She's not...she's Larry's girl.,6,4461
She's not Larry's girl.,6,356
From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,3,4462
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,6,4463
"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",6,4464
Because other people will suffer.,6,4465
"My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.",3,4466
You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.,6,4467
Well to hell with that.,3,4468
Did you ask Annie yet?,5,1205
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?,4,4469
Then I guess that's the end of it.,6,4470
But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,6,4471
"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",6,4472
"Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...",5,4473
Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.,6,4474
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,4475
Because it is.,6,370
"Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.",6,4476
It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,6,4477
No I don't want a diagram.,6,4478
"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",5,4479
Alright then.,6,4480
"Look, just give it some thought okay?",3,4481
I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,6,4482
But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,6,4483
What the hell is this?,3,383
I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,6,4484
Are you crazy?,3,385
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,0,4485
You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,3,4486
The business doesn't inspire me.,6,4487
"Oh, you have to be inspired.",6,3505
Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,1,4488
Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?,5,4489
Tell me something.  You can leave this business?,3,4490
Yes.  On this I would.,6,4491
You can't talk like that.,6,4492
Then help me stay here.,6,395
Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?,6,4493
"I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.",3,4494
I know.  Just you help me stay here.,6,4495
Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.,6,4496
I am thinking like that.,6,1235
I don't understand you do I?,5,4497
No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,4,4498
Yeah.  I can see that.,6,4499
Why did he invite her here?,5,403
Why does that bother you?,3,404
Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,5,4500
"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",6,4501
Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.,6,4502
uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?,5,4503
Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.,6,4504
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
Who said he even thought about that?,5,4505
I see it.  It has the appearance of it.,6,4506
"Well, so what?",3,2021
What's going on here Joe?,5,2794
Now listen kid...,3,4507
No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,6,4508
You can't read her mind.,6,417
"Then why is still single?  I mean there's plenty of single men in New York.  Why isn't she married by now?  Probably a hundred men has told her that she's foolish but, she's waiting.",5,4509
How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?,5,4510
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.",6,4511
"I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.",6,4512
"My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",6,4513
it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,6,4514
Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?,1,4515
"No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",3,4516
What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,4,1252
I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.,6,4517
But Kate...,6,4518
But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.,4,4519
"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",6,4520
Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.,6,4521
I can't do it all alone.,0,4522
"Calm yourself, alright?",6,4523
"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",6,4524
"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?",4,4525
"Look, just keep believing okay?",3,4526
"Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",5,4527
"Look at you, you're shaking.",4,433
I can't help it.,0,434
What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,5,4528
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,6,3550
I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it?,6,4529
"No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know?",1,4530
It's lovely here.,1,4531
The air is so sweet.,1,4532
You're not sorry you came?,5,1269
No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,0,4533
Why?,5,343
First of all your mother so much as told me to go.,3,4534
Well...,6,807
"Look,",3,3558
"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",6,4535
What?,5,328
"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",6,4536
Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,4537
"Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother.",6,4538
How did you know?,5,3563
"Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?",6,4539
"So, would you want to?",6,4540
"I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.",6,4541
"Well,",6,2053
Oh Annie.  I love you.  I love you a great deal.,1,4542
I love you.,1,900
I guess that's why I came.,6,4543
I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.,6,4544
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?,0,4545
"This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me.",6,4546
"Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.",6,4547
"Then he's gone forever, you sure?",5,4548
"Look, I almost got married two years ago.",5,4549
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me.,6,461
You felt something that far back.,6,4550
Every day since.,6,463
Why didn't you let me know?,3,464
"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",6,4551
You'd always be so ambiguous.,6,4552
"Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...",6,4553
"Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.",5,4554
I'll never forgive you for that.,0,4555
"How long, how long I've been waiting to do that.",6,4556
"I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.",5,4557
We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.,1,4558
Not like that you're not.,6,472
I kissed you.,6,473
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.,6,4559
"Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",0,4560
What is it?,5,3589
"No, what is it?  Your mother?",5,4561
"No, nothing, nothing like that.",6,4562
"Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.",0,4563
"Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me.",6,4564
You got to tell me.,6,1300
I don't know where to start.,4,3596
Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?,3,4565
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,6,4566
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
Well I lost them.,0,486
How many?,5,487
Just about all.,6,2081
Geez.,6,3599
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,6,4567
"For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.",6,4568
"That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.",6,4569
A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,6,4570
"It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?",6,4571
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,6,4572
And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,5,4573
"And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",6,4574
"It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",0,4575
"open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",6,4576
"cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",6,4577
Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,6,4578
And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,6,4579
And you still feel that way?,6,3612
I want you now Annie.,6,2093
Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.,3,4580
"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",6,4581
[GARBAGE] Annie,6,4582
Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.,1,4583
What am I going to do with a fortune?,6,3618
Buy some hats?,6,4584
"Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?",5,4585
Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.,6,4586
You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?,4,4587
Fine.,3,507
"Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.",5,4588
"But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?",5,4589
"Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",5,4590
What flashlight?,5,513
"You know, the flashlight, the silver one?  There's only one isn't there?",5,4591
It's not your flashlight.,6,4592
"Well, whose is it?",6,4593
It's ours.  Mine too.,6,4594
"Well, sure.",6,4595
"Well, you keep saying it's my flashlight like it's only your flashlight.  I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",5,4596
"No.  Of course, our flashlight.  Yours and mine.  Me flashlight is su flashlight, naturally.",6,4597
How could we have not thought to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,5,4598
Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember?,5,4599
Yes.,6,192
Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?,5,4600
"We should've brought the blanket, our blanket.",6,4601
"God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.",5,4602
"I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]",5,4603
I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,5,4604
"Look, I'm cold.",3,4605
Do you want my jacket?,6,529
"It's past eleven, let's go.",6,4606
What?  Are you kidding me?  We just got here.  We miss it.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,5,4607
There is no point in coming down here.,6,2119
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?,6,4608
So let's go.,6,2864
"I mean, don't you want to see it?",3,3643
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I don't know.  I just don't.,5,4609
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.",6,4610
"Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.",6,4611
"Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.",6,4612
"But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.",0,4613
"What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats.",6,4614
Yeah they do.,6,545
Augie.,6,4615
"Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.",5,4616
"I mean, I can't see how you can not be interested.",5,4617
I'm just not.,6,549
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
"I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.",5,4618
And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.,5,4619
"You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.",6,4620
Okay.  We're in a good spot.,6,4621
You didn't see them the first time either.,5,4622
"We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.",6,4623
"Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?",6,4624
"You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.",6,4625
"I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",6,4626
"Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...",5,4627
"...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",6,4628
"It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.",6,4629
They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,6,4630
"Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.",6,4631
That's the wind.,6,565
[BREATHING] So what do you think?,5,4632
About what?,5,567
About what I just said?,5,4633
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
It certainly is not.  It's,6,4634
So what do you think?,6,566
About what?,5,567
About what I just said?,5,4633
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,4635
"It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.",6,4636
I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.,5,4637
"Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",1,4638
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
"Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.",6,4639
I thought you wanted to see it.,6,591
It's just...,6,4640
"Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.",6,4641
"There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.",6,4642
"For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.",3,4643
Why not?,6,179
"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",5,4644
"Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.",5,4645
Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.,6,4646
"Carla, can I ask you something?",6,4647
What?,5,328
"Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?",6,4648
"Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.",3,4649
What's bugging you then?,5,4650
"Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...",6,4651
"Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",6,4652
I thought you wanted to see it.,6,591
"God, you don't understand anything.",6,4653
"No, of course not.",6,2164
"I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.",6,4654
"Well, we're going to see it.",6,4655
"No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.",5,4656
"What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.",5,4657
"You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem.",6,4658
"Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.",1,4659
"And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.",6,4660
"Look, do you remember the first time we came here?",6,4661
We thought I was pregnant.,4,3698
We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...,6,4662
Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.,4,4663
"And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.",1,4664
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,6,2176
What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?,5,4665
It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...,5,4666
And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.,6,4667
You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?,6,4668
I'd rather not remember something...,6,4669
Rather not hope for something.,0,4670
"Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance?",6,4671
No.,6,136
Do you want me to get some champagne?,3,3711
No.,6,136
Take off our shoes?,5,2182
No.,6,136
What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,5,4672
No.,6,136
Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?,5,4673
No...No...No...,6,4674
No...,6,4675
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,6,3716
Welcome to the human race.,6,4676
Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,6,4677
I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,6,4678
...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,1,4679
"This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.",3,4680
Yes it is.,6,625
Right.,6,533
Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,6,4681
No.  I know.  Me neither.,0,4682
This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,6,4683
I'm trying to do the best I can.,6,4684
I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,6,4685
I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,0,4686
Maybe if you were with someone else too.,6,4687
I didn't say that.,6,157
I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.,0,4688
"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",6,4689
Yeah?,5,636
Yeah.  Don't you know that?,5,637
If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,6,4690
"Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't.",6,4691
"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",6,4692
It seemed like a good spot to me.,1,4693
I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.,6,4694
Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,5,4695
Big old white moon.,6,4696
"Hey, look what we got here.",3,4697
Oh you brought refreshments.,6,4698
It's not champagne.,6,647
Well at least we won't need glasses.,6,4699
Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?,0,4700
No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,6,4701
I think this may be the place for us after all.,6,4702
I am sorry Augie.,0,4703
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,4,2212
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Good God.,5,654
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,6,4704
Well it must be them then.,6,4705
What are you going to do?,5,4706
We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling.,6,4707
Now and always sweet.,6,1467
I don't care then.,6,662
"I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.",6,4708
Hello?  Hello?  What?,5,4709
That sent shivers up my spine.,4,4710
"No, wrong number.",6,4711
What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?,5,4712
Behave exquisitely.,6,2221
With the most perfect poise?,6,2222
Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.,6,4713
um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?,4,4714
What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.,4,4715
"Oh, darling.  Don't say that.",4,4716
"It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.",6,4717
"You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?",6,4718
Yes.  I mean just that.,6,4719
What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?,5,4720
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,0,2231
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want.",6,4721
Who's they?,5,680
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.,6,4722
Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,1,4723
So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.,6,4724
"Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.",1,4725
How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?,4,4726
Who knows?,6,686
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,3,687
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,0,4727
"Well, dear, shall we want that?",6,4728
"Well, it depends on how well we've played.",6,4729
"What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?",5,4730
"Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.",6,4731
That's serious enough.,0,4732
"No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",6,4733
Darling I believe you're talking nonsense.,3,4734
"Oh, and who isn't talking nonsense?",5,4735
Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children.,0,4736
Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,1,4737
"Elliot, worms don't pop.",6,2978
"I don't care what you do, you see?  As long, no I don't care what you do, see?",3,4738
You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,3,4739
Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...,1,4740
...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.,3,4741
Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,3773
Which particular one?,6,703
The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,6,4742
"Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully.",5,4743
Horrible little thing.,4,4744
Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,0,4745
I hated it.,6,4746
How long did that rile last?,6,4747
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
"Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you-",6,4748
I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,6,4749
you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,3,4750
That was a rouser wasn't it?,6,4751
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me.,5,4752
I didn't hit you very hard.,6,2263
"The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers.",6,4753
I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].,5,4754
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,4755
We were very much younger then.,6,722
And much sillier too.,1,4756
The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,6,4757
Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,6,4758
"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",3,4759
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,6,724
Presents?  A trivial little broach.,5,4760
Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,6,4761
Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,6,4762
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,6,4763
You must admit he was in love with you.,6,4764
Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,0,4765
You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,3,4766
Well what of it?,3,4767
"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",6,4768
And what about me?,6,1542
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you would've never known anything.",6,4769
"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",1,4770
"Look, I'm bored with this conversation.",6,4771
"Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.",0,4772
You want some brandy?,6,4773
No thanks.,6,3001
I'll have a little I think.,6,4774
I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,5,4775
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,6,2284
I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,5,4776
Oh my...just because I just...okay...,5,4777
...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.,5,4778
It's become a habit with you.,6,745
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,6,4779
Don't be so stupid.,3,2289
Really Amanda.,6,4780
What?,5,328
Nothing.,6,749
[BREATHING],6,428
Going out somewhere dear?,5,2290
"No, just making myself beautiful for you.",6,4781
That reply has broken my heart.,0,752
That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,6,4782
Actually that's perfectly true.,6,4783
No it isn't.,6,755
Yes it is.,6,625
"Oh, be quiet.",6,2295
I think you should have some more brandy...,6,4784
I think that,6,4785
...cause really,5,4786
it doesn't seem to be working on you.,5,4787
"perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy, it might've made you a little less disagreeable.",6,4788
Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you.,6,4789
"Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",3,4790
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",3,760
Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,3,4791
They sting.,3,1567
They snap.,3,2300
I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.,3,4792
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,6,763
"Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",5,2302
I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?,6,4793
Mind your business.,6,3817
"Mmm, you must've had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",1,4794
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,3,4795
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,6,3820
You've always had a weak head.,6,769
"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",6,4796
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",6,4797
"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",5,4798
Shut up.,3,774
We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,6,4799
"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",5,4800
"Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",6,4801
You better turn that off.,6,3825
Why?,5,343
Because people upstairs will get annoyed.,3,4802
There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.,6,4803
Well there are people downstairs I suppose.,6,4804
They are away in Tunis.,6,780
"Oh, this is no time to be in here for Tunis.",0,4805
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
No I'll do no such thing.,3,4806
Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,6,4807
"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",3,4808
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,3,2323
Turn it--Turn it off.,3,4809
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,3,4810
Very amusing indeed.,1,3038
"I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",3,4811
"You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",6,4812
"This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",4,4813
You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,6,4814
"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",4,4815
Just shut up.,3,4816
shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.,3,4817
"Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-",4,4818
Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.,0,4819
Oh.,6,103
"Hi.  Um, excuse me I've been to, like, five of the desks here and nobody seems to be able to tell me what it is I need to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  Can you possibly help me?",5,4820
"Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?",6,4821
Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.,6,4822
"You need a new license, is that what you're telling me?",5,4823
Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license.,6,4824
Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.,6,4825
Okay.  I did-,6,4826
Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line.,0,4827
I did exactly what they told me to do.,6,4828
I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.,6,4829
Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?,4,4830
I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?,6,4831
I've got a life too ma'am,1,4832
and I got to - i got to work here all day long.  Okay.  I've got to deal with you people all day.,6,4833
So what I need you to do is I need you to fill out this form correctly and go to the back of the line.,6,4834
"Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please?",6,4835
There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.,4,4836
"What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,",6,4837
I've been to the back of the line five times.,6,4838
fill out this form and wait,6,4839
You're going to have to go back again.,6,4840
Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,6,4841
This whole area here you didn't initial,6,4842
and you filled out-,6,4843
"Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.",6,4844
Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.,6,4845
I have been waiting for over an hour.,6,4846
This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place,6,4847
"Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that",6,4848
I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.,6,4849
"and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form.",6,4850
Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really,5,4851
Look can you not just help me?,3,4852
I can't help you right now.  Do you understand that?,4,4853
I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.,1,4854
Look I'm going on my lunch break right now.  So you're just going to have to take this form and go to the back of the line.,6,4855
No.  No.  No. No. You have to help me.,0,4856
like I said before right now.,6,4857
This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,6,4858
That's like the whole purpose of you being here.,6,4859
Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?,4,4860
I- I- I'm testing your patience?,5,4861
You're testing my goddamn patience.,3,4862
I'm testing your patience?,6,4863
"I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?",6,4864
Yeah.  You have to be here all day.,6,4865
I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.,0,4866
"Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.",3,4867
I've walked away already.  I'm not here anymore.,5,4868
So you're leaving tomorrow.,6,4869
Yeah.  They just called.,6,4870
This is really-this is unfair.,3,4871
I know.,6,39
I don't see [BREATHING],6,4872
I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.,0,4873
"I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.",0,4874
"And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.",4,4875
I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.,6,4876
You don't know that.,5,4877
I need you to believe that too.  How am I supposed to believe everything's going to be okay if you don't?,5,4878
"I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.",5,4879
Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,6,4880
You do have a choice.  You don't have to go.,6,4881
Do you think I want to leave you?,6,4882
You have a choice.,6,4883
I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,0,4884
I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.,6,4885
You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.,6,4886
Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on,6,4887
And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,0,4888
I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.,0,4889
It's just not going to work out without you here.,6,4890
What's that supposed to mean?,5,4891
I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,5,4892
Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,6,4893
Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,6,4894
I can't deal with this emotionally.,0,4895
What do you want me to do?,3,4896
I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.,0,4897
Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.,0,4898
You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.,6,4899
"You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.",6,4900
Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,6,4901
I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,6,4902
That's all I'm saying... No you don't.,6,4903
Thanks that helps.,1,4904
It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.,3,4905
I feel much better now.,1,4906
"You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.",6,4907
I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.,6,4908
Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-,3,4909
I will but I can't right now.,0,4910
Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?,5,4911
You know- you know how this works.  I have to go.,6,4912
Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.,6,4913
That's how you want to leave it?,6,4914
"I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?",5,4915
You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,6,4916
I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,6,4917
Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.,6,4918
Fine.,3,507
I have something to tell you.,6,4919
What?  You seem so excited.,5,4920
It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?,1,4921
"Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.",1,4922
Look.,6,4923
Are you serious?  You're getting married.,5,4924
Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.,1,4925
Holy shit that's amazing.,5,4926
I know. I'm so-,4,4927
Congratulations.,1,4928
Thank you. [LAUGHTER],6,4929
"I'm invited, right.",1,4930
You think. [LAUGHTER],6,4931
"I'll have to, uh, I'll have to get myself a new tux.  My, uh, the old one is a little worn and dirty.  That's awesome.  Where are you guys going to have it?",6,4932
"Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.",1,4933
Do you remember up by Yosemite? Yeah.,6,4934
"Well, that's- that's- that's beautiful. That's a beautiful place to do it.",1,4935
We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER],1,4936
"Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff.",6,4937
So pretty.,1,4938
That's great,1,4939
I hope- they're not like,6,4940
Very Midsummer Night's wedding.,1,4941
"Right.  Nice.  That's great.  I hope while we're up there nobody gets attacked by any, like, bears or wolves or anything.",1,4942
Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.,1,4943
"Well no, I am- I'm trying to be positive",6,4944
I'm trying to be positive.  I'm trying to say I hope that doesn't happen.,6,4945
"Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help",5,4946
We're going to be in the middle of the wilderness. These kind of things happen,6,4947
plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.,6,4948
Yeah.  I'll help plan.,6,4949
Yeah?,5,636
Yeah.,6,2
Really?,5,123
Sure.,6,4950
"Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time.",6,4951
"I'm thinking greens, lots of greens. Greens and browns.  We're nature.",6,4952
Okay.,6,185
No.  No browns.,6,4953
Why not browns?,6,4954
It's a wedding.,6,4955
"It's a light brown, tanish.",6,4956
Blue for the sky.,6,4957
Come on.,3,4958
I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-,6,4959
who- Who's getting married though?,5,4960
I know but you just asked me to-,6,4961
to help plan because I'm getting married. [LAUGHTER],6,4962
So we're going to go greens and browns.,6,4963
No.,6,136
"Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me?",6,4964
Just for me.  Come on.  I'm your best friend.,6,4965
It's not your wedding. You can-,6,4966
I'm your best friend,1,4967
You know what? You know what?,5,4968
Give me the browns.,6,4969
"You can't ruin my mood today.  If you want to wear a brown tux, you go ahead and wear a brown tux",6,4970
Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?,6,4971
but bridesmaids aren't wearing brown and I'm not wearing brown.,6,4972
Blue?,5,4973
Maybe,6,4974
"Okay, fine. Greens and blues.",6,4975
I like blue.,1,4976
Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?,6,4977
That would work.,6,4978
Yeah?,5,636
"Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.",6,4979
"Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?",1,4980
"Yeah.  I hadn't actually thought about the cake yet, but",6,4981
"I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.",6,4982
Yes.,6,192
"Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.",6,4983
See this is why you have to help.,6,4984
because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.,6,4985
Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.,6,4986
Well right but you can help.,0,4987
Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.,1,4988
I'm thrilled.  God.,1,4989
Ha ha ha.,1,4990
Ha ha.,1,4991
Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend,5,4992
Just couldn't be any cooler.,6,4993
"You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing",5,4994
I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.,5,4995
Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.,5,4996
I'm so- all the blood,5,4997
You don't look like you're going to faint.,4,4998
"has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.",5,4999
I'm getting a little weak in the knees.,0,5000
So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?,6,5001
"You know that I've never-I- I have a long run of bad relationships but, you know, I mean, you got to work through it.  It's fine.",6,5002
What about Kathy?  I mean you guys have been dating for a while.,5,5003
"Yeah, but",6,5004
You haven't ruined it yet.,6,5005
"Yeah.  I know but it's, you know, maybe we'll get married.  I don't know.  Should be pretty-",1,5006
You really like,1,5007
"I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.",5,5008
What?  She could be just as excited as I am right now.,5,5009
You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.,1,5010
"Oh, I've made her that excited.",1,5011
[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.,6,5012
What?  You've heard me talk about it before.,5,5013
[laughter],6,5014
I'm a monster in bed.,6,5015
Hey.  Get out of the way.  I'm watching TV.,6,5016
That's helpful.,6,5017
I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.,5,5018
Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.,6,5019
I am try-  it's been three years,5,5020
and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.,6,5021
"Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.",6,5022
I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-,6,5023
I don't know.,5,257
"Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much.",1,5024
"Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.",1,5025
I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.,5,5026
Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.,6,5027
What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.,5,5028
You need that- Time-,6,5029
"You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-",6,5030
Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.,6,5031
"look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-",3,5032
"Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.",6,5033
I don't know.  I mean whatever.,5,5034
Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-,6,5035
Clearly.,6,5036
Okay that's helpful.  Thanks.,1,5037
Look I'm sorry okay. It's just-,0,5038
Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.,3,5039
"I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.",6,5040
Well don't you understand that this is-,6,5041
"Yeah, I understand, but-",6,5042
I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.,6,5043
"I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-",6,5044
I mean it's not like this is an,6,5045
extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.,0,5046
Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.,3,5047
"Okay. Okay, Fine.",3,5048
"'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-",6,5049
Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?,4,5050
I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-,1,5051
Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?,6,5052
Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.,6,5053
"And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?",6,5054
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually.,6,5055
"and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,",6,5056
"Yeah, I- I make my",4,5057
I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview.,6,5058
"you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.",6,5059
or some- some large percent of- of success.,6,5060
"Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote.",6,5061
"Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-",6,5062
Buck-O. That's really helpful.  Just keep chugging along.  The little engine that could.,6,5063
"What do you want me to? Look, Hey look if I could- Don't get all sassy.",3,5064
Well you- just you're doing something wrong.,3,5065
"Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm-",3,5066
Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else.,6,5067
"Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-",0,5068
I'll get it.  I just need a job.  I don't care what it is.,6,5069
"So, go to McDonalds.",6,5070
Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.,6,5071
Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-,6,5072
I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.,6,5073
Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem?,6,5074
What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.,5,5075
I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-,5,5076
I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.,6,5077
I'm trying to be helpful.,0,5078
"I'm trying to be helpful and you're just, like, coming at me with, like, attacks.",6,5079
Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.,6,5080
I'm trying to watch TV.,0,5081
I'm trying to watch TV. TV.,6,5082
That's important.  That's really important.,1,5083
Welcome to Northwest Airlines.  How can I help you?,5,5084
You guys lost my bag.,3,5085
Did you file a complaint already?,5,5086
Yeah.  Yeah I did.,6,5087
Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?,5,5088
"I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?",5,5089
"Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-",6,5090
Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.,5,5091
I understand that ma'am.,6,5092
"Lost it just, like, I mean,",6,5093
"Ma'am, I understand that.",6,5094
it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,6,5095
"because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.",5,5096
"I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.",6,5097
Wait.  What?,5,5098
"At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-",6,5099
No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.,5,5100
"You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",5,5101
you're getting very excited right now,5,5102
"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",6,5103
"I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.",6,5104
Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,3,5105
What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.,6,5106
If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.,6,5107
We're just talking over each other.,6,5108
We're not going to communicate anything this way.,6,5109
I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.,6,5110
Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to,6,5111
sign away your luggage to the,6,5112
I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-,3,5113
"It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-",6,5114
You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.,3,5115
"Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,",6,5116
No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,4,5117
terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over,6,5118
The best that we can do for you is give you-,6,5119
Ma'am.,6,5120
I want to talk to your supervisor.,4,5121
I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.,6,5122
"I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.",3,5123
"I am the supervisor, ma'am.",6,5124
"Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?",5,5125
I am the current manager on duty.,0,5126
"Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.",6,5127
"Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines.",6,5128
"Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-",0,5129
Thanks.,6,1839
"When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.",0,5130
"You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.",6,5131
Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.,4,5132
"I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?",5,5133
Yeah.,6,2
"Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,",6,5134
Yeah. I know. I know.,6,5135
"you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like",6,5136
"you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.",6,5137
It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.,1,5138
"Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-",6,5139
"He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.",0,5140
Yeah.,6,2
It just doesn't seem fair.,6,5141
"It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.",6,5142
You're okay,6,5143
Thank you for being here.,1,5144
You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,1,5145
[LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.,6,5146
Yeah.,6,2
And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER],6,5147
"That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.",1,5148
"Yeah, I know.",6,1850
So-,6,5149
"Hey, what's up?",5,5150
Guess what came today?,5,5151
What?,5,328
My acceptance letter.,1,5152
Get out.,3,5153
From U.S.C..,6,5154

"Yes, I am.",6,4146
"Oh, my god what happened.  You got in. Otherwise you wouldn't be so happy. [LAUGHTER]",5,5156
"Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER]",6,5157
That's awesome.  Congratulations.,1,5158
Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C..,0,5159
That's amazing.  Wow.,5,5160
I know. [LAUGHTER],6,5161
You're going to have to get like a nine millimeter because U.S.C.'s like in South Central.,6,5162
"[LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No.",6,5163
[LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.,6,5164
"No, seriously. No, seriously, you should do it.",3,5165
The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.,1,5166
I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-,4,5167
"Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?",6,5168
I'll get you- I'll get you a bottle of mace.,6,5169
There we go.  Perfect.,6,5170
And a taser and a knife.,4,5171
And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.,6,5172
And you'll be fully loaded.,6,5173
I don't want any of those little puny ones.,6,5174
"So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?",6,5175
Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.,6,5176
"Underwater basket weaving, my god.",5,5177
"U.S.C. has a major in that, right.",6,5178
They have- they have that,6,5179
They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.,6,5180
they have that as a major?,5,5181
That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.,5,5182
Okay.  Well I'm lying but-,4,5183
"Seriously, what's your major?",5,5184
"Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out.",6,5185
So you're undecided?,6,5186
Yeah.,6,2
"Hey, that's cool.",1,5187
"I know 'cause then I can do whatever I want, right.  I can try classes in this and then try classes in that and then pick whatever I like best.",6,5188
"No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.",1,5189
okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER],6,5190
"Uh, well-",6,5191
And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.,6,5192
You- you- you'll find.,6,5193
"Yeah, I know.  That's right. Yeah, yeah. Because I live in LA.",6,5194
Right.,6,533
and I like living in LA.,1,5195
"So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-",4,5196
"You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.",6,5197
I would miss you.,0,5198
Yeah. But now we don't have to.,6,5199
Right.,6,533
Everything worked out perfectly.,6,5200
That's awesome.,1,5201
I know.  We should have a party.,6,5202
We should have a party.,6,5203
An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.,1,5204
You got accepted-what?  to a U.S.C. party?,5,5205
No.  An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER],1,5206
"Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.",6,5207
A party celebrating your acceptance.,1,5208

"I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is.",6,5216
What- what did you have in mind?,5,5217
"Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and",1,5218
"actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on",1,5219
[LAUGHTER],6,452
Vermont.,6,5220
You just did not ask me on a date to Red Lobster.,6,5221
"Wait, you've been there before?",5,5222
On occasion I've heard of it.,6,5223
"Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome.",1,5224
Yeah.  Totally.,6,5225
"Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.",6,5226
I am totally down with the ice cream.,6,5227
Okay.  Putt-putt golfing?,6,5228
"Eh, we can work that part out.",6,5229
"Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go.",6,5230

Yay for me.,1,5239
"That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school.",1,5240
I know.,6,39
Are you going to take out loans or-,6,5241
Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.,0,5242
"Well hey, it's okay, fine, gees.",1,5243
"Well no.  I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job",6,5244
while I'm in school.  It'll be good.,1,5245
Sweet.,6,5246
Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.,6,5247
"Well, it's not far.",6,5248
I know.  Right down the street.,6,5249
"That's right.  There's lots of like, there's lots of doughnut shops, like, everywhere.",6,5250
"Right, there's always that option. The doughnut thing.",6,5251
I mean There's pretty much doughnut shops everywhere in LA.,6,5252
Right,6,627
"But, um-",6,5253
and like most places really.,6,5254
"I mean, like, I don't know.  I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash.  You can, you know",6,5255
Work at a doughnut shop.,6,5256
Or library.,6,5257
"Maybe on campus, I hear they have jobs on campus.",6,5258
I just said the library,6,5259
"or, um, campus cruiser.  You can drive people around.",6,5260
Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.,6,5261
Right or you can run for student counsel.,6,5262
"Okay.  No, that's dorky.",6,5263
Dorky?,6,5264
Yeah.,6,2
It's important.,6,5265
Student counsel?,6,5266
Yes.,6,192
"No, it's dorky.",6,5267
Fine.  It's dorky.,6,5268
Social life.  Hello.,6,5269
But that'll fit you  because you're a dork.,6,5270
[LAUGHTER].,6,5271
[LAUGHTER].,6,5271
[LAUGHTER].,6,5271
[LAUGHTER].,6,5271
I dork.,6,5272
"No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the",4,5273
"Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by",6,5274
ditsy valley girls and,6,5275
lots of money and,6,5276
lots of drunk frat boys,6,5277
Right.,6,533
Yeah.,6,2
"But, hey. They have- they have- they have free, uh",6,5278
What have you heard about the Greek system?,6,5279
free buffets and free events.,6,5280
Free nothing. 'Cause you have to pay tons of money anyway.,6,5281
"I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.",6,5282
Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?,6,5283
"I think I'll live on campus the first year cause you  meet more people that way, right?",6,5284
"Oh, yeah? In a dorm?",5,5285
"Well, yeah.  I mean that's where you meet people, right.  Everybody lives in the dorms, right.",6,5286
"I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-",1,5287
"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.",0,5288
"No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus",6,5289
"and I mean, you know, I knew my roommates and stuff but I there wasn't really that sense of community-",6,5290
Right.,6,533
"that happened, you know, that was going on.",6,5291
So basically what you're saying is that I was right,6,5292
I was just joking.  Gosh.  You don't have to take everything so- so seriously.,5,5293
"I'm- I'm right, right.",6,5294
"Yes, you're right.",6,5295
That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER],6,5296
All hail to the,1,5297

"to you, yes.",6,5299
Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?,5,5300
"Yeah, um.  I have been trying to reach somebody who will refund, uh, my money.",6,5301
"Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food",6,5302
um and everything was pretty much uh- uh- just not done right. All the orders were messed up.,0,5303
"Okay.  Well, Did you go through the automated menu?  Most of your requests can be taken care of through that.",6,5304
"Yes, I did and that didn't- I got through to, like, one operator and she sent me to like three others",6,5305
and now I'm talking to you.  And all I want is my money back.  That's all I'm asking for. It's not much.,6,5306
Okay.  Well I'd be happy to-,1,5307
"If you could just give me that, then I will leave you alone. And just- if i could also- What?",6,5308
"Okay, sir.  I'd be happy to help you.",1,5309
"Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there.",6,5310
"Yeah, Beverley Hills.",6,5311
"Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?",6,5312
The food was prepared incorrectly.,6,5313
I asked for no tomatoes.,3,5314
"Can you be a little more specific, sir?",6,5315
"I asked for no tomatoes on six tacos.  I got tomatoes and onions on all of them,",5,5316
"Um, hairs were found in three out of the six.",6,5317
"Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?",3,5318
"Yeah.  I did and they're like you've got to take it up with corporate, and I'm like well fine.  I'll have your ass by the end of the day and so now I'm trying to do that.",6,5319
"Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?",0,5320
"It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.",6,5321
"Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address.",6,5322
"Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.",6,5323
"Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now",6,5324
"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.",3,5325
"I understand, sir.  I will explain to them what the situa-",6,5326
You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.,5,5327
You're right sir.  It is your particular situation but I will call the other operator.  I will explain to them what's going on. You won't have to tell your story again.,6,5328
You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.,6,5329
You're going to fill out a form on your desk,6,5330
because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.,3,5331
"Okay, sir.  They- they have to-",6,5332
Sir.,6,5333
"Sir, they have to take down your address at the other station.  I will transfer.  I will explain everything to them.  It will all be fine.  I promise.",6,5334
What's your name?,6,230
Cindy?,5,5335
Cinnee?,5,5336
Cindy.,6,5337
Cindy?  Cindy what?,5,5338
"Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant-",6,5339
"Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check",6,5340
"attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.",3,5341
"Alright, sir. Sir.  I'm going to transfer you to the address.",6,5342
"Alright.  You know what, sir.  The customer is always right.",6,5343
"You know what.  I- You know what? You know what? No, it's fine. it's fine it's fine You know what?",3,5344
I will go ahead and I will take- I will take,6,5345
"Hey, Cindy. Cindy, look I know this is not your fault.  Do whatever you want.",3,5346
Send me to whatever operator. I just- You know what?  I'm just done.  I'm just done.  I've lost all hope.,6,5347
"Sir, customer satisfaction is our first goal.  I will go ahead and take your number and your address down myself.",6,5348
"of getting my sixteen dollars back. It fine, no honestly.",3,5349
"No, Cindy just don't even-look don't even.  Cuz I- look Cindy I know you don't care about me, okay.  I know that I'm just like another person who calls-",3,5350
Wait. But I-,6,5351
But I'm giving you what you want.,6,5352
No it doesn't matter.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Just send me to the next operator.  That's fine.,6,5353
"Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?",6,5354
Yes.,6,192
Okay.  Great.,1,5355
What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,6,5356
He saw it.,6,318
How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,5,5357
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,5,5358
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,5,1951
"I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.",5,5359
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
"No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",6,5360
He cried hard?,5,1954
I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,4,1955
What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,4,5361
I guess he is.,6,325
He's getting just like after he died.,0,5362
What's the meaning in that?,6,3440
"I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.",4,5363
What?,5,328
"Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",6,5364
What do you mean dishonest?,3,330
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,5,1962
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",3,1185
I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,6,5365
"Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",4,5366
You can't say that to him.,6,335
We've got to say it to him.,6,336
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,5,4445
For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,6,5367
To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,6,5368
Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,6,5369
The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.,3,5370
"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",6,5371
Why?,5,343
You know why.,6,5372
Well I got an idea but what's the story?,6,5373
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1,346
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",6,347
You know it's not only my business.,6,1973
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,6,1974
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,6,5374
Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-,6,5375
Then it isn't just my business.,6,5376
I'm just saying.,6,353
Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,3,5377
Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,6,5378
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,6,2761
She's not Larry's girl.,6,356
"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.",6,5379
"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",6,5380
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.",3,5381
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,6,1204
To hell with that.,3,361
Did you ask Annie yet?,5,1205
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,6,5382
"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",6,5383
"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.",6,5384
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,0,367
So what I'm not fast with women.,6,2770
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,1211
Because it is.,6,370
Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,6,5385
I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.,0,5386
"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",6,5387
"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",6,5388
You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,3,5389
Alright then mom.,6,5390
Just give it some more thought.,6,380
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",6,5391
"and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",0,5392
What the hell is this?,3,383
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.",6,5393
Are you crazy?,3,385
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it.,0,5394
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,5,5395
"The business, the business doesn't inspire me.",6,5396
Must you be inspired?,6,2005
"Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",1,5397
I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,0,5398
You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,5,5399
Yes on this I would.,6,5400
Well you don't want to think that way.,6,5401
Then you help me stay here.,6,5402
Alright but don't think that way,6,5403
"because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",3,5404
I know.  Just you help me stay here.,6,4495
But don't think that way.  You hear me?,3,5405
I am thinking that way.,6,5406
I don't understand you do I?,5,4497
No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,4,5407
Yeah.  I can see that.,6,4499
Why did he invite her?,3,5408
Why does that bother you?,3,404
It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?,5,5409
Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,6,5410
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,407
What do you mean?  He was brought up next door to the girl his whole life.  Why shouldn't he want to see her again?,5,5411
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,3,2016
She's not going to marry him.,0,5412
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,5,411
It's got that about it.,6,412
Well so what.,6,5413
"What's going on here, Joe?",5,2022
Listen kid.,6,5414
"No, line.",6,5415
"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",5,5416
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",6,2024
You can't read her mind.,6,417
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?,5,5417
Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,6,5418
How do you know why she waited?,5,419
Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,6,5419
"In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,5420
Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?,1,5421
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.",3,5422
What do you want me to do?,3,4896
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",6,5423
But Kate-,5,5424
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",4,5425
"Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?",6,5426
"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-",6,5427
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",0,5428
Calm yourself.,6,429
Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,5,5429
Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.,6,5430
You above all have got to believe.  You.,5,5431
Why me above all?,5,3546
Just don't stop believing.,3,5432
"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",4,5433
I can't help it.,0,434
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?,5,5434
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,6,2044
I know it went out of style didn't it?,6,5435
It's okay.  It's a good thing.,1,5436
You know it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,1,5437
You're not sorry you came.,0,440
"Not sorry, no but I'm not staying.",0,5438
Why?,5,343
"In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",6,5439
Well.,6,443
You saw that and you- you've been kind of-,6,5440
What?,5,328
Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,0,5441
The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,5442
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",6,1275
How did you know?,5,3563
From her point of view why else would I come?,5,1276
Wouldn't you want to?,3,5443
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,6,5444
I guess this is why I came.,6,2821
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",1,2822
I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.,6,5445
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I,0,5446
"wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each other.",6,5447
"You think this is wrong, this chair, this yard.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",6,5448
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",6,5449
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,5,2062
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me.,6,461
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Every day since.,6,463
"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",5,2825
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.",6,5450
"Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.",5,5451
"I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",5,5452
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,5,5453
"Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1,5454
Not like that you're not.,6,472
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",6,474
What is it Chris?,6,5455
Let's drive some place.  I want to be alone with you.,0,5456
"No.  What is it Chris, your mother?",5,5457
"No, nothing like that.",6,5458
Well then what's wrong?  Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,6,5459
Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.,6,5460
You've got to tell me.,6,481
I don't know where to start.,4,3596
It wouldn't work this way.,6,2078
There's so many things mixed up.,6,5461
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,6,4566
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
Well I lost them.,0,486
How many?,5,487
Just about all.,6,2081
"Oh, gees.",6,5462
It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,6,5463
"For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",6,5464
I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,6,5465
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,3,5466
"And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",5,5467
a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,6,5468
And then I came home and it was amazing.,5,5469
There was no meaning in it here.,6,5470
The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again.,6,5471
"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",0,5472
because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,6,5473
"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",6,5474
I mean you can take those things out of war but,6,5475
"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",6,5476
Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,6,5477
I guess that included you.,6,5478
And do you still feel that way?,6,5479
"I want you now, Annie.",6,3613
"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything",6,5480
that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.,6,5481
You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.,6,5482
"Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.",1,5483
What'll I do with a fortune?,3,2097
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.,5,5484
"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid to miss it.  How you doing?",4,5485
Fine.,3,507
"Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell",5,5486
"although if you can't tell, it probably isn't them.  It will probably be unmistakable.  Don't you think?  How you doing?",5,5487
"Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.",5,5488
What flashlight?,5,513
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",5,5489
It's not yours.,6,5490
Whose is it?,5,516
It's ours.  It's mine too.,6,2107
Well sure.,6,5491
You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?,5,5492
"No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?",5,5493
I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?,5,5494
Yes.,6,192
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",5,5495
"Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",5,5496
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,5,2115
"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?",5,5497
I'm cold.,0,528
Do you want my jacket?,6,529
It's after eleven let's go home.,6,5498
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,5,5499
There is no point in coming down here.,6,2119
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
That's my point too.,6,1350
So let's go home.,6,5500
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",3,5501
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I just don't.  It's stupid.,3,539
Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,6,5502
Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,6,5503
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",6,5504
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",6,5505
This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,0,5506
What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,5,5507
"Yeah, they do.",6,1360
"Oh, Augie.",6,1361
Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do,6,5508
"like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic",6,5509
a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.,5,5510
I'm just not.,6,549
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,5,5511
Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions.,0,5512
We weren't in a good spot.,0,2134
We didn't see them the first time either.,5,2135
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.,6,5513
"I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.",5,5514
"Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",1,5515
Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,5,5516
No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,6,5517
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,6,5518
It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,6,5519
They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,6,5520
where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,6,5521
"Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",6,5522
That's the wind.,6,565
Well so what do you think?,6,5523
About what?,5,567
What I said.,6,5524
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
"Well, so what do you think?",6,2145
About what?,5,567
What I said.,6,5524
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,573
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,5,5525
I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,6,5526
"Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",1,5527
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,0,5528
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period?",6,5529
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,3,5530
Well then what's bugging you?,3,5531
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,6,5532
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",6,5533
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",6,5534
Why not?,6,179
We totally skipped. Right.,6,5535
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",6,5536
"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",6,5537
Why not?,6,179
We never do.  Do we have we ever?,6,5538
We've missed them twice that's not ever.,6,5539
Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,6,5540
We'll see them this year.,6,5541
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.",6,5542
"God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,",1,5543
and the fish won't show up.,0,5544
I thought you wanted to see it.,6,591
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,3,1408
"No, of course not.",6,2164
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.,6,5545
It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.,6,5546
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",6,5534
I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,6,5547
Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.,1,5548
"Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.",6,5549
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.,6,5550
We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,5,5551
"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",6,5552
right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,6,5553
"And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,5554
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,6,2176
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",4,5555
"It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?",6,5556
"That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.",6,5557
I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,6,5558
Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?,6,5559
No.,6,136
You want me to get some champagne?,3,5560
No.,6,136
Take off our shoes?,5,2182
No.  No.,6,5561
Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?,5,5562
No.,6,136
Want to get married again?,0,5563
No.,6,136
What?  What do you want a divorce?,5,5564
No.,6,136
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
"A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?",5,5565
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,6,5566
Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.,6,5567
"Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.",6,5568
Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,5,5569
"No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",6,5570
"Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,",6,5571
"you know what you get Carla, this.",6,5572
"This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.",5,5573
Yes it is.,6,625
"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,5574
Right.,6,533
But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,6,5575
"No, I know me either.",6,5576
"This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",6,5577
I'm doing the best I can.,6,630
"I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",5,5578
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,6,2199
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.",0,5579
"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",3,5580
Yeah?,5,636
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,3,5581
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,1,5582
"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",6,5583
Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.,6,5584
I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.,5,5585
I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.,6,5586
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",5,5587
Well look at what we got here.,6,5588
"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",6,5589
It's not champagne.,6,647
Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,6,5590
You still cold?  Do you want to go home?,5,5591
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.,0,5592
"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",4,652
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Good God.,5,654
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,6,5593
It must be them then.,6,658
Well what are we going to do?,6,5594
"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",6,5595
Now and always sweet.,6,1467
I don't care then.,6,662
It was bound to come sooner or later.,6,2217
Hello.  Hello.  What?  Wrong number.,5,5596
Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.,4,5597
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,4,1473
Behave exquisitely.,6,2221
With the most perfect poise.,6,2957
Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.,6,5598
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",4,5599
What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,4,5600
"Don't say that, my darling.",6,5601
It's true the whole business is very poor joke.,6,5602
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love.,6,5603
"Yes, meaning just that.",6,2229
What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean?,5,5604
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,0,2231
"You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want.",3,5605
Who's they?,5,680
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.,3,5606
"Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths",1,5607
flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,6,5608
"If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",1,5609
Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright.,1,5610
"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?",3,5611
Well who knows?,6,5612
We always want to bicker and fight.,3,5613
No that fire will fade long with our passion.,6,5614
"Oh, dear shall we like that?",6,5615
It all depends on how well we've played.,6,5616
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?,6,5617
Yes.  Yes.  with all his might.,6,5618
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",3,693
"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",6,5619
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",3,2247
So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,0,5620
Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.,6,5621
Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,1,5622
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",6,2251
"I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over",3,5623
and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,4,5624
"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",3,5625
Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,4,5626
Which particular one?,6,703
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,6,5627
"Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.",6,5628
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,6,5629
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",0,5630
How long did that row last?,6,709
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,6,5631
It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,6,5632
"Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it?",6,5633
That was the first time you ever hit me.,5,2262
You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard.,6,5634
Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,6,5635
I shall never forget his face.,6,5636
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,4755
We were very much younger then.,6,722
And very much sillier.,1,723
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
"There was nothing in that, you know that.",6,5637
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,6,724
Presents a trivial little broach.,6,5638
I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,6,5639
Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,6,4762
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,5640
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",6,5641
"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",6,2274
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,6,2275
What of it?,5,732
What of it?,5,732
It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,1,733
What about me?,4,734
"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",6,5642
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",1,736
"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",0,5643
So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?,0,5644
No thanks.,6,3001
"I'll have some myself, I think.",6,5645
I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,5,5646
No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones.,6,5647
seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,5648
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,6,5649
It's become a habit with you.,6,745
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,6,5650
"Oh, don't be so stupid.",3,5651
"Really, Amanda.",5,748
What?,5,328
Nothing.,6,749
"Going somewhere, my dear?",5,5652
Just making myself fascinating for you.,6,5653
"Ah, that reply has broken my heart.",0,5654
The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.,6,5655
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",6,2293
"Oh, no it isn't",5,5656
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"Oh, be quiet.",6,2295
It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,6,5657
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,6,5658
"Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",3,5659
Adders don't snap they sting.,3,3015
Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,3,5660
They sting.,3,1567
They snap.,3,2300
"I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",3,5661
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,6,763
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",6,1569
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,6,5662
Mind your own business.,6,766
"You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow.",1,5663
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,3,4795
I'm not in the least drunk.,6,2307
You always had a weak head.,6,1575
I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,6,5664
"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,5665
Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.,6,5666
"Oh, shut up.",3,5667
"They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots.",6,5668
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",5,2312
Very good idea.  I will.,1,5669
You'd better turn that off I think.,6,5670
Why?,5,343
It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,3,3826
There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,6,5671
There are people downstairs I suppose.,6,5672
They're away in Tunis.,6,2318
This is no time of year for Tunis.,6,781
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
I'll do no such thing.,3,2320
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,6,1585
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,3,2322
You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,3,5673
Turn it off.,6,787
"Go away, go away.  I hate you.",3,5674
"Amanda, listen.",6,5675
Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.,4,5676
Stop.,3,5677
Very amusing.,1,5678
"Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",3,5679
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",6,5680
"This is the end do you understand?  The end,",6,5681
You're not going like this.,6,794
finally and forever,6,5682
"Oh, I am.  Let go of me.",6,5683
You're not.,6,796
"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.",3,5684
Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,3,5685
"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",6,5686
I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,0,5687
"Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.",6,5688
Okay.  What's the problem?,3,5689
"And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form",6,5690
"that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.",6,5691
"Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?",6,5692
"Yes, I do.",6,5693
Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.,0,5694
"This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.",6,5695
"I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.",6,5696
Don't you -- you don't have-,3,5697
are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?,5,5698
I don't have any of,6,5699
I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.,6,5700
"But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--",6,5701
"Nope, I don't. I don't have-",6,5702
or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.,6,5703
"No, I can't. That's-",4,5704
I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.,0,5705
"Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--",3,5706
"Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need",6,5707
look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not,5,5708
"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,",0,5709
but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to,6,5710
What if I pay you money?,3,5711
"Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?",6,5712
twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.,6,5713
"Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --",4,5714
"Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.",0,5715
"I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.",6,5716
"And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.",6,5717
Well I just -- I can't do that right -- can you please just grab the form? All you have to do is grab the form.  I'm not gonna ask anything else of you.,6,5718
I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.,6,5719
That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-,6,5720
"Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk",6,5721
It's not rocket science.,6,5722
"Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there.",6,5723
I can't do that.,0,4266
I know it's right over there.,6,5724
Why are you being such a bitch?,3,5725
"I'm sorry, but I can't do that.",0,5726
"Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?",6,5727
So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.,6,5728
Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,0,5729
"Fine, which line is it?",3,5730
The one you just came from.,6,5731
"Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.",6,5732
Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.,1,5733
It's only going to be a year.,6,5734
It's the first year of your child's life.,1,5735
There's really -- there's nothing I can do.,0,5736
You're just fine with this?,3,5737
There's nothing I --,6,5738
You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?,6,5739
"It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.",6,5740
"When you get back, think of all of the things that you're going to have missed.",6,5741
"I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives.",6,5742
Don't go.,3,5743
I can't do that.  I have to go.,0,5744
"Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.",5,5745
I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.,0,5746
"You've made a pledge to us, too.  Remember that day, we stood in front of each other and said 'til death do us part.  Put on some rings and it's supposed to mean something.",6,5747
I know that. I know that. I know that.,6,5748
"There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.",0,5749
"And this is what I do.  This is -- I mean, this is my life.  And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year.  I'll be back.",6,5750
Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?,6,5751
It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that.,6,5752
"Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand",6,5753
Because it's impossible.  There's -- I just can't.  I can't.,0,5754
You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?,5,5755
Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.,6,5756
"Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.",6,5757
It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life.,0,5758
"And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?",6,5759
I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year,0,5760
Then why do you have to go a year at all?,5,5761
Because I've already agreed to that.,6,5762
Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.,0,5763
"Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.",6,5764
This is supposed to be a partnership.  We're supposed to do this together. I'm not supposed to be left here to do this by myself while you leave.,6,5765
It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.,6,5766
"What am I supposed to do, read your letters?",5,5767
What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.,4,5768
"There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.",6,5769
We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.,6,5770
Just tell them no.,6,5771
"I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay.",0,5772
"I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave.  I want to stay here with you.",0,5773
"Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.",3,5774
Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?,3,5775
I've asked already.  I can't go back.,0,5776
"It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option.",0,5777
When do you leave?,6,5778
Next week.,6,5779
A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.,6,5780
"You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.",1,5781
Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.,3,5782
"I am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you.  I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation.",4,5783
"If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.",6,5784
There's nothing I can do.  I-- I,0,5785
"Fine, fine.  We have to be together.  If you can't stay here, then I'll go with you.  I don't care where you go.  We'll go, too.  I'm not staying behind.",6,5786
They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.,0,5787
"It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.",6,5788
Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.,3,5789
Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.,6,5790
[BREATHING],6,428
"I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.",6,5791
"Look, I--",3,5792
You're not really giving me a lot of options.,6,5793
Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.,6,5794
But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.,6,5795
But I've been trained.  You have no training.,6,5796
I'm not going to stay here and wait.,6,5797
You have to.  Do you understand me?  You have to.,5,5798
I can't do it.,0,5799
"Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we?",6,5800
"So, um, well, I just -- I kind of wanted to, you know, tell you that I'm actually -- I proposed to Kate and we're going to get married.",1,5801
"Wait, what?",5,5802
"Yeah. Yeah, I proposed to her yesterday. We're getting -- we're engaged now and we're going to -- we're going to get married in about eight months.",1,5803
"Oh, my God.  Congratulations.",5,5804
"Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?",1,5805
I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?,5,5806
Well I decided to take her sailing,1,5807
"and we were just out on the water and, you know, I just -- I had the ring with me.  And I was like let's do this.  And she was like okay and then we're getting married.",6,5808
[LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.,6,5809
"Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.",6,5810
Did she cry?,0,5811
"She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...",1,5812
"Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?",5,5813
"Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.",5,5814
I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!,5,5815
"Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.",6,5816
"Yeah, it is.",6,1439
"But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of",6,5817
"help Kate out with like planning stuff. I mean, if you want to.  I mean, you guys are good friends anyway so I figured, you know, if you guys want to like -- I mean, you know, I'm sure you enjoy that kind of thing.",1,5818
"Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]",1,5819
Okay. Well there you go.,6,5820
"Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--",5,5821
I think we're going to -- we're going to -- we want to do it in Hawaii and just fly everybody in.,6,5822
"Oh, my God.",5,3156
"I just -- 'cause, I mean, Hawaii just has like the best fruit buffets.  And so I'm just going to say forget, you know, all like kind of meats and all that stuff.",6,5823
"It's just going to be like a all fruit--fruit buffet wedding, plus a cake.",6,5824
Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.,6,5825
Barefoot?,5,5826
Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.,6,5827
"Um, no, no, no.  It'll be in like a park near the beach.",6,5828
Okay.,6,185
Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--,1,5829
"Are you going to have a big wedding or like keep it really small like just, you know, family and really close friends?  Or, I mean--",6,5830
"It'll be kind of small, but not, you know, not tiny, you know.  I want to have, you know, as many people as we can afford to fly out to Hawaii and put up there for--",6,5831
It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?,1,5832
It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--,5,5833
Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER],5,5834
"Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-",1,5835
I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-,1,5836
"Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-",6,5837
Well I'm glad you told me.,1,5838
"Yeah, yeah.",6,5839
It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.,1,5840
"Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.",4,5841
"But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.",1,5842
"And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.",6,5843
And how did she feel about that?,6,5844
She's okay with it.,6,5845
Well that's good.  It'll be a great wedding.  You're willing to compromise on things.,1,5846
"Exactly, exactly, exactly.  So--",6,5847
She's going to let you have say in the wedding choices?  That's pretty impressive. Very forward-thinking woman. [LAUGHTER],5,5848
"Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.",6,5849
And brown.,6,5850
All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,6,5851
This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER],6,5852
Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.,6,5853
All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER],6,5854
"So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--",6,5855
"Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,",4,5856
"it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind.",3,5857
Well there has to be something you haven't tried.,6,5858
"I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,",6,5859
"local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -",0,5860
What about like a temp agency?,6,5861
"Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.",6,5862
"there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.",5,5863
"Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on.",6,5864
"Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and",6,5865
"I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.",3,5866
"Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.",6,5867
I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.,0,5868
"But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.",5,5869
"Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.",6,5870
"No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?",4,5871
"Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.",6,5872
I'm not choosing. I'm not-,6,5873
"If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.",6,5874
"No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them",6,5875
"-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.",6,5876
"Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.",6,5877
This is stupid.,3,5878
"I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--",6,5879
"You know what, this is your fault.",3,5880
Excuse me?,3,5881
It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--,3,5882
It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?,3,5883
"Yeah, exactly.",6,5884
Well that sounds like your fault.,3,5885
Yeah.,6,2
You didn't do what I told you to do.,3,5886
That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because,3,5887
"-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.",3,5888
That's amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault.,5,5889
"Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?",6,5890
I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.,6,5891
That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.,0,5892
Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?,5,5893
Yours.  I don't--,6,5894
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"You see what you just did there, though?",5,5895
"I had- No, I don't.  I'm sorry.  I just totally screwed this one up.  You can stop it I guess.",0,5896
"Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing.",6,5897
"Hi, how can I help you?",0,5898
Just arrived from London--,6,5899
Mmhmm.,6,165
lost my luggage. Your airline--,0,5900
I'm sorry.,0,2501
Right.,6,533
"lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.",6,5901
"Oh, oh, you didn't.",5,5902
I thought you lost your luggage.,5,5903
"It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.",5,5904
"Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure.",3,5905
"And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.",6,5906
'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.,6,5907
"Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.",0,5908
"Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar",6,5909
fifty dollars?,5,5910
refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes,0,5911
"fifty dollars. No way, no.",6,5912
"That's our policy, sir.",6,5913
"I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.",6,5914
You understand?,5,5915
"What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --",6,5916
I can't do that.,0,4266
But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.,6,5917
"Uh, no, actually, no I'm not.",6,5918
"No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--",6,5919
I'm very sorry.  I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight.,0,5920
You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.,6,5921
You--,3,5922
We'll cover fifty.,6,5923
No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.,6,5924
We only cover fifty do-,6,5925
"Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.",6,5926
We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.,6,5927
And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-,6,5928
"I'm going to get very upset.  Like, I mean, I'm- I'm upset right now but I'm going to get really upset if you- if you don't do the check thing.",3,5929
I'm very sorry.,0,5930
I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.,0,5931
"You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.",3,5932
We really -- we want to work with you. We really -- we want to help.,0,5933
I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-,6,5934
"Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--",6,5935
But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.,6,5936
I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--,6,5937
"No, it's not going to be -- but it's not going to be fifty, it's going to be a hundred and fifty.  You're going to write three, you understand, three of- of the forms.  You're going to write three of them out and then give it to me.",6,5938
"Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you--",6,5939
You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.,3,5940
"We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.",6,5941
"Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,",4,5942
No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.,6,5943
I can write you the one check.,6,5944
but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.,6,5945
All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.,6,5946
"But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--",6,5947
But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person,6,5948
"I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.",1,5949
We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.,3,5950
then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?,5,5951
"No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.",6,5952
But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.,4,5953
And your bag is not my concern.,4,5954
The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.,6,5955
"Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--",3,5956
I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.,1,5957
You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.,6,5958
So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms,4,5959
with different names on them? That-,5,5960
Then that would be lying.,3,5961
"but, no. See, 'cause",0,5962
if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.,6,5963
I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.,0,5964
"Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but",6,5965
"I understand you're frustrated, but--",3,5966
"um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.",6,5967
I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.,6,5968
Please.,6,153
"But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey",6,5969
"I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.",6,5970
"Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.",6,5971
"And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.",0,5972
But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.,6,5973
"Oh, yes.",6,5974
But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.,6,5975
"I'm sorry, really.  But--",0,5976
I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.,5,5977
That I'm sorry?,0,5978
"Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.",6,5979
"So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?",6,5980
"Hey, how you doing?",5,5981
I'm sorry.,0,2501
Thanks.,6,1839
"I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--",6,5982
"I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,",6,5983
a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.,5,5984
I'm sorry.  It's never easy.,0,5985
Yeah.,6,2
"But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --",6,5986
Thanks.,6,1839
--it doesn't really do anything.  But--,6,5987
I just -- it's just not fair.,6,5988
I know.  It never is.,6,5989
"How's, um -- how's his parents doing?",6,5990
"I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they",6,5991
feel the same way everybody else does.,0,5992
"I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-",4,5993
"[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.",6,5994
"Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.",6,5995
Yeah.,6,2
"I mean, we can be grateful for that.",6,5996
"Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--",6,5997
You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.,3,5998
"It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.",1,5999
This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.,4,6000
"Just life, in general?",6,6001
"I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -",6,6002
"there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.",6,6003
"I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.",6,6004
I don't know what to do.,0,3928
"When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--",4,6005
"I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.",6,6006
I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.,1,6007
"Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.",0,6008
Yeah.,6,2
I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.,6,6009
I know.,6,39
"Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.",6,6010
"I don't have any magic answers.  But,",6,6011
"I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.",6,6012
I know.,6,39
"Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..",5,6013
"What, no way.",3,6014
I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.,6,6015
Really?,5,123
"Yeah, yeah.",6,5839
I didn't even,6,6016
know you applied to U.S.C..,6,6017
"I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but",6,6018
it's a really good school.  So,1,6019
"Um, um- yeah, I'm just -- I'm really excited 'cause I don't know.  It's like a whole -- I mean, it's just like, I've been really -- I wanted to go there ever since I was a kid.  So now I actually am and it's awesome.  It's a really nice campus.  Oh, you've been there.",1,6020
"That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?",5,6021
"Um, I'm thinking a history and geology minor.",6,6022
Wow.,5,101
"Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.",1,6023
Right.,6,533
Yeah.,6,2
Yes.,6,192
"And, uh-",6,6024
Is U.S.C. known for its history program?,6,6025
"Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school",6,6026
"and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-",6,6027
I know.  It's a great school and you know,1,6028
"I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program.",6,6029
It's all about the connections,6,6030
"So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]",1,6031
"Oh, you did not just say that.",5,6032
"Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school",1,6033
I know.  You're going to be so close.,5,6034
"And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome",1,6035
I'm glad you did.,1,6036
So um,6,6037
"That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here.",1,6038
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're only going to be like twenty minutes apart.",6,6039
Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.,6,6040
"Exactly. It's more like twenty five. Twenty five, half an hour,",6,6041
Give or take. [LAUGHTER],6,6042
"But, uh, yeah, so I'm really excited. I can't wait- can't wait to go.  I have to go to orientation,",1,6043
Well congratulations.,1,6044
"umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses",6,6045
find out all this stuff.  And- and I don't know.  I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm.,5,6046
Yeah.,6,2
"'Cause, you know, it's like you get to know a lot of people in the dorms and.",6,6047
"Yeah, and then you got that whole communal shower thing which is really appealing.",6,6048
Well I'll have flip flops for that.  That's not  some- It's not a problem.,6,6049
"Okay. Well, that's a good plan. Shower shoes. Two thumbs up.",6,6050
"Yeah, yeah.  But um, so, yeah.  So it's pretty sweet, huh?  You should go there, too.",1,6051
Wow. I- I was looking at U.C.L.A.,5,6052
"Ouch.  That's, um -- oh, wow.",5,6053
"But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing.",1,6054
"No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --",6,6055
"The -- what, the- I mean--",5,6056
"No, I'm just messing with you. I mean, I'm not going to, you know, I mean, I'm not even really a football fan anyway.  So or- or a basketball-",3,6057
"You're not going to -- you're going to go to games, though, right? I mean, you can't go to U.S.C. and not go to a football game.",6,6058
No. Football's boring.,0,6059
"Just one game, though?  I mean, for the experience.  I mean, you don't have to go to all of the games but you gotta go to a game.",6,6060
I'll go to basketball games.,1,6061
"Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--",1,6062
Maybe some golf matches.,6,6063
"Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]",5,6064
Do they even have any golf matches? I don't even know.,5,6065
I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.,5,6066
I don't know. Women's volleyball.,6,6067
"That I'll go to.  Definitely go to women's volleyball.  Women's volleyball, swimming, tennis.",6,6068
Basically anything women do.,6,6069
"And then men's basketball.  And -- oh, well not women's basketball.",6,6070
You have to go to a football game.  Come on.,6,6071
"No, I'm not going to go to a football game.",6,6072
"Paint some red and yellow S C on your face. And like get one of those big you know, number one hand things.",6,6073
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.,3,6074
Maybe one of those megaphones. Pompom.,6,6075
I do -- I will need to get a gun-,6,6076
"There are cheerleaders at football games.  That's girls, scantily clad sexy girls.",6,6077
You've got a point there.,6,6078
I know.,6,39
I'll take that in consideration.  Alright.,6,6079
I'm just -- I'm watching your back.,6,6080
"Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean",4,6081
Excuse me?,3,5881
I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife,6,6082
No.,6,136
"'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus",6,6083
Well just don't go south of campus.  Don't get a gun. That's stupid. I mean-,3,6084
Well I need to defend myself from,4,6085
Why don't you take kung fu?,3,6086
Thank you for calling Sprint.  We care about everybody.  How can I help you?,6,6087
Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.,0,6088
Are you sure you didn't make them?,5,6089
I'm positive.  They came from like another state.,6,6090
"Can I get your phone number, please?",6,6091
"Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.",6,6092
I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file--,6,6093
Okay.  three two three six nine seven five zero six six.  Can we move on?,6,6094
Okay.,6,185
"Okay, cool.",6,6095
"Umm, Miss Aruckman",6,6096
Yes.,6,192
I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.,6,6097
"Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can",6,6098
Well I'm looking at these.,6,6099
"take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those.",6,6100
So can you please refund the mischarged charges,6,6101
So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.,6,6102
I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.,6,6103
"Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--",6,6104
So could you discretion it back?,6,6105
All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.,6,6106
"Okay, but that's like half",6,6107
What I can,6,6108
of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.,6,6109
What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form,6,6110
which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.,6,6111
"Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it",4,6112
"but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.",5,6113
"Ma'am, I understand that.",6,5094
And I did everything they said.  And now i'm talking to you and you're supposed to put the money back on my account because I didn't make the calls and I'm really tired of dealing with this because I didn't even,6,6114
"Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.",6,6115
Excuse me?,3,5881
And then then you'll get some money back.,6,6116
How long does that take?,6,6117
A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.,5,6118
I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?,6,6119
"Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.",6,6120
Really?,5,123
"Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.",6,6121
You're just going to put it back on my account.,6,6122
"I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.",6,6123
So you're just going to take care of this for me?,6,6124
Sure.,6,4950
"Oh, my God, thank you so much.",5,6125
You're welcome.,6,6126
"I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously",1,6127
"No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um",1,6128
make my life a lot easier.,1,6129
"You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um",4,6130
Really?,5,123
"Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.",6,6131
"Right. Um, Thanks for asking, though. I mean, you sound nice, you know.",6,6132
"God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever",6,6133
"if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.",6,6134
I'll,6,6135
"call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool",6,6136
"Wow, alright. Well, thanks. And, uh, you- you have a good one.",5,6137
Alright. Take Care.,6,6138
You too.,6,6139
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,6,6140
He saw it.,6,318
How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,5,5357
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,5,5358
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,5,1951
"I don't know.  After it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",6,6141
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.,6,6142
He cried hard?,5,1954
I heard him right through the floor of my room.,4,6143
What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,4,5361
I guess he is.,6,325
He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?,6,6144
"I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.",4,6145
What?,5,328
Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,6,4438
"What do you mean, dishonest?",3,3444
You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,6,6146
What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,6,332
I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.,6,6147
Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him.,4,6148
"Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.",4,6149
You can't say that to him.,6,335
We've gotta say it to him.,6,6150
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,5,4445
"For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",6,6151
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?",6,6152
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,6153
"The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.  So we have to keep--",6,6154
"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",6,6155
Why?,5,343
You know why.,6,5372
"Well I've got an idea, but what's the story?",6,6156
Going to ask her to marry me.,1,6157
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",6,347
You know it's not only my business.,6,1973
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,6,1974
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?,6,6158
Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --,6,6159
"Well, then you know it's not only my business.",6,6160
I'm just saying.,6,353
"Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",3,6161
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,6,6162
She's not Larry's girl.,6,356
"From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.",6,6163
"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",6,6164
Now what can I do for you?,3,6165
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",3,6166
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,6,1204
To hell with that.,3,361
Did you ask Annie yet?,5,1205
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,6,5382
"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.",6,6167
"The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.",6,6168
So what?  I'm not fast with women.,5,6169
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,1211
Because it is.,6,370
"Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.",3,6170
Line?,5,6171
"Alright, then, mom.",6,6172
"Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.",6,6173
Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,6,6174
"Yeah, let's keep going.",6,6175
Just give it some more thought.,6,380
I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,6,6176
"father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",0,6177
What the hell is this?,3,383
I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York.,6,6178
Are you crazy?,3,385
I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.,6,6179
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,5,5395
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0,388
Must you be inspired?,6,2005
"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",1,6180
I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,0,6181
You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business?,5,6182
"Yes, on this I would.",6,1228
You don't want to think like that.,6,6183
Then you help me stay here.,6,5402
"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",3,6184
I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,6,6185
"But don't think that way, you hear me?",3,6186
I am thinking that way.,6,5406
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",4,1236
"Yeah, I can see that.",6,6187
Why did he invite her here?,5,403
"Oh, God, line.",5,6188
Why does that bother you?,3,404
"Why does- why, does that bother you?",5,6189
"She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",5,6190
"Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.",6,6191
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,407
What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?,5,6192
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,3,2016
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,5,411
It's got that about it.,6,412
Well so what?,5,6193
"What's going on here, Joe?",5,2022
Line.,6,6194
"Now listen, kid. Now, listen.",3,6195
"Oh.  Now listen, kid.",6,6196
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",6,2024
You can't read her mind.,6,417
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",5,6197
How do you know why she waited?,5,419
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",6,6198
"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",1,2028
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",3,6199
What do you want me to do? What do you want?,3,423
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",6,6200
"But, Kate--",6,6201
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",4,5425
Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,6,6202
She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,0,6203
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone",0,6204
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Only last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.",5,6205
"Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.",6,6206
"You, above all, have got to believe.  You.",6,6207
Why me above all?,5,3546
Just don't stop believing.,3,5432
"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",4,5433
I can't help it.,0,434
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",3,435
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,6,2044
"I know.  It went out of style, didn't it?",6,6208
"It's okay.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's lovely here and the air is sweet.",1,6209
So you're not sorry you came?,5,6210
"No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.",0,6211
Why?,5,343
"In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",6,5439
You saw that and then you've been kind of--,6,6212
What?,5,328
"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",6,2051
The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,6213
"I knew they would, your mother, anyway.",6,6214
How did you know?,5,3563
"From her point of view, why else would I come?",3,6215
Well wouldn't you want to?,3,6216
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,6,5444
I guess this is why I came.,6,2821
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",1,2822
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.,0,6217
I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other.,6,6218
"You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",4,6219
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",6,5449
Then he's gone forever?  You're sure?,5,6220
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me.,6,461
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Every day since.,6,463
"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",3,2064
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.",6,6221
"Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a -",6,6222
"I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.",5,6223
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,5,6224
"Anne, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1,6225
Not like that you're not.,6,472
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?",6,6226
Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.,0,6227
"No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?",5,6228
"No, no, nothing like that.",6,6229
"Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",6,6230
"Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",6,6231
You've got to tell me.,6,481
I don't know where to start.,4,3596
It wouldn't work this way.,6,2078
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",5,2079
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
Well I lost them.,0,486
How many?,5,487
Just about all.,6,2081
"Oh, gees.",6,5462
It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,6,6232
"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",6,6233
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,3,5466
"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",6,6234
a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,5,6235
"There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",6,6236
because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,0,6237
"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",5,6238
"You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",6,6239
And do you still feel that way?,6,5479
"I want you now, Annie.",6,3613
"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.",6,6240
"And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",6,6241
"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",1,6242
What'll I do with a fortune?,3,2097
"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better.",5,6243
"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?",4,6244
Fine.,3,507
"Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",5,6245
"How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.",5,6246
What flashlight?,5,513
"The flashlight; the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",5,6247
It's not yours.,6,5490
Whose is it?,5,516
"It's ours.  It's mine, too.",6,6248
"Well, sure.",6,4595
You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?,5,6249
"No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.",6,6250
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?",5,6251
Yes.,6,192
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",5,5495
"Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.",5,6252
I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,5,6253
I'm cold.,0,528
You want my jacket?,5,6254
It's after eleven; let's go home.,6,6255
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,5,5499
There is no point in coming down here.,6,2119
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
"That's my point, too.",6,6256
So let's go home.,6,5500
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",3,5501
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I just don't.  It's stupid.,3,539
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",6,6257
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.",6,6258
"Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.",6,6259
There's mystery here and magic.,6,6260
What are you so excited about?,5,6261
"Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.",0,6262
This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,6,6263
"Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.",6,6264
There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,5,6265
I'm just not.,6,549
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
"I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.",5,6266
"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",6,6267
We weren't in a good spot.,0,2134
We didn't see them the first time either.,5,2135
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -,5,6268
"no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",6,6269
Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;,5,6270
"just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.",6,6271
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,6,6272
"They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",6,6273
That's the wind.,6,565
Well so what did you think?,5,6274
About what?,5,567
"Look at this, goose bumps.",6,6275
Well so what'd you think?,5,6276
About what?,5,567
What I said.,6,5524
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,6277
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,5,5525
I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,6,5526
Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.,1,6278
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",6,2151
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?",6,6279
"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",3,6280
Well what's bugging you?,3,6281
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,6,5532
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",6,6282
"For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions.",6,6283
Why not?,6,179
"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",5,4644
We've missed them twice.,6,586
That's not ever.,6,6284
Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,6,6285
We'll see them this year.,6,5541
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",0,6286
I thought you wanted to see them.,6,2903
You don't have any idea what I'm saying.,5,6287
"No, of course, not.",6,6288
"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",0,6289
It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.,6,6290
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",6,5534
"I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.",6,6291
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.",1,6292
"Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;",6,6293
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?,5,6294
"uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.",6,6295
Uh.,6,6296
"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",6,6297
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,6298
"Wait a minute, I've got it.",6,1420
Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,4,6299
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.",6,6300
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,6,609
Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?,6,6301
No.,6,136
You want to get some champagne?,5,6302
No.,6,136
"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",5,2922
No.,6,136
You want to get married again?,5,1429
No.,6,136
"What, you want a divorce?",5,6303
No.,6,136
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
"A new carpet?  A poodle?  An ice cream?  A back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What, Carla?  What the hell do you want?",5,6304
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,6,5566
"Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",6,6305
"No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.",6,6306
"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",1,6307
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,1438
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,6308
Right.,6,533
But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,6,5575
"No, I know, me neither.",6,6309
"This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",6,6310
I'm doing the best I can.,6,630
"I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",5,6311
"Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?",6,6312
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",0,2200
"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",3,6313
Yeah?,5,636
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,6,6314
"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",6,6315
"Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",6,6316
"I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.",5,6317
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.",5,6318
"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",4,652
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Good God.,5,654
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
"Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,6319
"It must be them, then.",6,6320
What are we to do?,6,3747
"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",6,5595
Now and always sweet.,6,1467
"I don't care, then.",6,6321
It was bound to come sooner or later.,6,2217
"Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number.",5,6322
"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",4,6323
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,4,1473
Behave exquisitely.,6,2221
With the mo- with the most perfect poise?,6,6324
Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.,6,6325
"Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they?",4,6326
But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,4,6327
"Don't say that, darling.",6,6328
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,6,2227
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",6,2228
"Yes, meaning just that.",6,2229
"What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,6329
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,0,2231
"You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.",3,6330
Who's they?,5,680
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.,1,6331
"If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",1,6332
Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.,1,6333
"How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?",3,6334
Who knows.,6,2238
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,3,687
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,0,4727
"Oh, dear.  Should we like that.",6,6335
It all depends on how well we've played.,6,5616
"What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?",6,6336
"Yes.  Yes, with all his might.",6,6337
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",3,693
"No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",6,6338
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",3,2247
"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.",0,6339
"Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",1,6340
"Elliot, worms don't pop.",6,2978
"I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",3,6341
"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.",3,6342
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,702
Which particular one?,6,703
The one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed?,5,6343
"Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.",5,6344
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,6,5629
I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,0,6345
How long did that row last?,6,709
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,6,5631
"It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.",6,6346
Line?,5,6171
How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?,5,6347
That was the first time you ever hit me.,5,2262
I didn't hit you very hard.,6,2263
"The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",6,6348
"Ah, I shall never forget his face.",6,6349
"How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,6350
Yes.  We were very much younger then.,6,6351
And very much sillier.,1,723
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",6,713
That was the first time you ever hit me.,5,2262
I didn't hit you very hard.,6,2263
"The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",6,6352
I shall never forget his face.,6,5636
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,4755
We were very much younger then.,6,722
And very much sillier.,1,723
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
You knew there was nothing in that.,5,2990
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,6,724
Presents?  A trivial little brooch.,5,6353
"I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,6354
Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,6,4762
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,5640
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",6,5641
"Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.",6,6355
Line?,5,6171
Let him kiss you.,6,6356
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,6,2275
What of it?,5,732
What of it?,5,732
It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,1,733
What about me?,4,734
"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",6,5642
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",1,736
"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",0,5643
So am I; bored stiff.,0,6357
You want some brandy?,6,4773
"No, thanks.",6,2281
"I'll have a little myself, I think.",6,6358
I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,5,5646
"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones.",6,6359
It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,6360
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,6,2286
It's become a habit with you.,6,745
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,6,5650
"Oh, don't be so stupid.",3,5651
"Really, Amanda",5,6361
What?,5,328
Nothing.,6,749
"Going out somewhere, my dear?",5,6362
"No, just making myself fascinating for you",6,6363
Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.,0,6364
"The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",6,6365
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",6,2293
"Oh, no, it isn't.",6,6366
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"Oh, be quiet.",6,2295
Line?,5,6171
It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.,0,6367
It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,6,6368
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,6,5658
Line?,5,6171
"Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",3,6369
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",3,760
"They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",3,6370
They sting.,3,1567
They snap.,3,2300
I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.,3,6371
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,6,763
"Yes, I did, quite a lot.",6,6372
"I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?",6,6373
Mind your own business.,6,766
You must have had a riotous time.,3,6374
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",1,6375
You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.,3,6376
I'm not in the least drunk.,6,2307
You always had a weak head.,6,1575
I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.,6,6377
"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,2309
Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?,6,6378
"Oh, shut up.",3,5667
"We might get up a splendid little- a splendid little debate about this, you know, intemperate tots.",1,6379
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",5,2312
Very good idea.  I will,1,6380
You better turn that off I think.,6,6381
Why?,5,343
It's late and the people upstairs will get annoyed.,6,6382
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,6,2316
"There are people downstairs, I suppose",6,6383
They're away in Tunis.,6,2318
This is no time of year for Tunis.,6,781
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
I will do no such thing.,3,783
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",6,2321
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,3,2322
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,3,4810
Turn it off.,6,787
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,3,2323
We swapped. Listen.,6,6384
Listen--,6,6385
"Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.",4,6386
"You're a vile tempered, loosed living",6,6387
Stop.,3,5677
wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.,3,6388
Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.,3,6389
"This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.",6,6390
You're not going like this.,6,794
"Oh, yes, I am.",6,6391
"No, you're not.",6,6392
"Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.",3,6393
Shut up. Shut up.,3,2333
"You're a mean, evil minded",6,6394
Marry you again? Huh.,5,6395
little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.,6,6396
"Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.",0,6397
Whore.,6,6398
Swine.,6,6399
"Hi, I need an ID.",6,6400
"ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from.",0,6401
No.,6,136
"Okay, I'm sorry, but I just stood in this line for an hour.  can I Is there any way I can-",0,6402
"I mean, there's really nothing I can do for you in this line.  This is not the line for new I.D.  This is the line for registration.",6,6403
"No, they told me-I'm sorry, but they told me to be in this line.",0,6404
"Yeah, I understand that ma'am.  I don't know what they said to you, but you need to be in a different line.",6,6405
"What, I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here?",5,6406
"Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.",6,6407
Can you just-can I just get the right-,6,6408
"Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry.",0,6409
Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?,6,6410
There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--,4,6411
I know.  I've been in line with these people.  I understand.  I understand what it's like.  Could you please like call over and-,6,6412
"I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration.",6,6413
"I hear that.  I hear that.  Thank you, but I've waited in line for so long, and I don't want to have to be here all day.",0,6414
I don't have those-,6,6415
"So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-",6,6416
"I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A.",0,6417
And how long is that going to take?,6,6418
"Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.",6,6419
I don't-,6,6420
"There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.",0,6421
"I don't have time for this today, and-",0,6422
"But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.",6,6423
"Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?",6,6424
"I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.",6,6425
Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.,6,6426
"Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.",6,6427
"what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.",5,6428
"No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.",6,6429
"what The lady, what? the janitor?",5,6430
No.,6,136
"You asked the janitor what line to stand in?  Obviously, that's not going to be the right thing.",6,6431
"No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.",0,6432
"I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.  I think you just said that you were stupid.",3,6433
Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.,6,6434
"It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.",6,6435
Why not?,6,179
There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.,6,6436
"Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?",6,6437
I told you it was line two A.,6,6438
"Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.",6,6439
I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry.,0,6440
Do you have a manager I could speak with?,6,6441
I am the manager.,1,6442
Are you being straight with me?,3,6443
"I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A.",6,6444
Fine.,3,507
Thank you very much.  You have a wonderful day.,1,6445
"baby, I need you to sit down.",0,6446
What is it?,5,3589
um.,6,6447
You can say it.,6,6448
I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call--,5,6449
Are you all right?,3,6450
"Yeah, um everything's fine so far. um",6,6451
"I got a call today,",5,6452
And um--,6,6453
okay.,5,4368
I'm going to need to go overseas for a while.,0,6454
You got called up.,6,6455
Iraq.,6,6456
I thought you said this wasn't going to happen for at least a year.,5,6457
"I'm sorry.  I thought so. ""sigh""",0,6458
What am I going to do?,5,3960
"I don't know ""sigh"".",6,6459
I can't do this by myself. I I don't know how to do this.  You know how to do this.,4,6460
The kids-,6,6461
I know.  I know.,6,6462
Nobody's even here.  Your parents live on the other side of the country.,6,6463
"I know.  Well, we'll have to figure all that out.  I mean, I think the Army's going to provide childcare and help us out with that. um.",6,6464
Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?,5,6465
Iraq.,6,6456
What are you going to do there?  Is it going to be dangerous?  What are you-?,4,6466
I think infantry.  I'm not sure.,6,6467
It's--,6,6468
Can we do something else?  Can you tell them that you just had two kids?,5,6469
"It's going to be at least six months, probably a year. I tried.",6,6470
I don't understand why they would just do something like this?,5,6471
"I know, I know.  It's really, really messed up.",6,6472
It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.,6,6473
"Believe me, if I had a choice, I wouldn't have chosen this.",6,6474
I don't know I don't know what I'm going to do.  I don't know how to-,5,6475
"You don't know how to what?  You'll be fine. I mean, you're a great parent. I know.",6,6476
"They're six months old. Six months old, they're tiny.",6,6477
I can't do this.  I've never done this before.  I don't know anything about this.,0,6478
"Well, maybe you should move in with my mom and she can help.",6,6479
"Your Your mom, you want me to move in with your mom?",5,6480
"I don't know, I'm just--I'm trying to think of something.",6,6481
She doesn't even like me.  She's never liked me. No.,6,6482
"She likes you. Of course, she likes you.",6,6483
She likes you.  She likes the kids.,1,6484
"I no I can't- ""sigh""",0,6485
You can't what?,5,6486
I can't let you go.  I can't let you go.  I'll call them.  I'll say something.  I'll do anything.  I'll tell them something different.,4,6487
I don't think there's anything we can do.,6,6488
I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.,6,6489
"Well, we can try it.  Baby, don't beg me.  I mean, if there were anything that I could do, I would do it.  Believe me.  This is not what I want.",6,6490
It's not fair.,3,31
I know.  I know it's not fair.,0,6491
Why has to be you?  There's all those other people.  Somebody else can go instead.  It's not right.,6,6492
"Well, apparently nobody else can go.",6,6493
What are you going to do that's any different than anybody else?,5,6494
"I don't know.  Baby, why are you asking me this?  It's just as hard for me.  Please, try to understand that.",5,6495
"I don't know.  It's not me, so I'm the one who has to stay here.  I'm the one who has to take care of them, and I don't have-I don't have anybody else.  You're all I have.",6,6496
"I understand, baby.  I'm sorry. I mean try to understand I'm I'm scared myself.",4,6497
I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.,4,6498
I know.,6,39
Iraq of all-come on.  People die every day.,0,6499
I know.,6,39
I jus-,6,6500
We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us?,6,6501
I don't know.,5,257
Maybe we should call your parents.,6,6502
Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say.,6,6503
"Yeah, we'll call them.  We'll figure something out.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You're right.",6,6504
I'm going to miss their first words.,0,6505
I know.,6,39
You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.,6,6506
"All the time, every day, every day.  They have e-mail over there and stuff like that, right? I can send you pictures.",6,6507
I don't know. I hope so.,6,6508
You have to call me all the time whenever you can.  You have to tell me what you're doing and how you're doing.  Okay?,6,6509
"Yeah, as much as I can.",6,6510
How long do we have?  When do you leave?,6,6511
"""sigh"" Three weeks.",0,6512
Three weeks?,5,6513
Yeah.,6,2
"I don't Okay.  Okay, we can do this.  We can do this.  It's okay.  We'll make it work.",6,6514
Yeah.,6,2
I love you.,1,900
"I love you.  I'm going to miss you so much. ""sigh""",0,6515
"Okay, so big news.",6,6516
What?,5,328
"Come on, what?",3,6517
I'm getting married.,1,6518
Shut up.,3,774
Yeah.,6,2
No way.,6,6519
Yeah.,6,2
He asked you?,5,6520
Uh-huh.,4,194
"No way, when? when,when, When did it happen?",5,6521
Just a couple days ago.,6,6522
Oh my gosh.,5,6523
[LAUGHTER],6,452
And you actually said yes.  I can't believe it.  I never thought you would get married.,5,6524
I know me neither.,6,1442
Oh my gosh.,5,6523
"Right, I thought I would be way older too. I thought I would be I be at least thirty something.",6,6525
Oh absolutely.,6,6526
"Well, we always said we'd be in our thirtieth when we got married. And we were going to get married to each other if we didn't by then",6,6527
Yeah.,6,2
"I know, right. What'd we say, when we were thirty nine?",6,6528
"Thirty nine, yeah.  I can't believe it.  So you broke our pact. Thanks a lot.",5,6529
Sorry.,0,6530
"Thanks a lot.  Well, okay, you've got to tell me the details.  What did he say?  Where was it?  What happened?",6,6531
"Um, Well, uh, I don't-I don't know how much planning he had done.",6,6532
"Okay.  That's okay, spontaneous is great.  Spontaneous is awesome.",1,6533
"Actually, but--",6,6534
It was really beautiful.,1,6535
You've got to love that.,6,6536
"Yeah, we went to a really great jazz show, and um-",1,6537
"Nice, you love the jazz.",1,6538
"Yeah, and after, we went up to this um, this place like a restaurant on the roof kind of thing.",6,6539
"Oh, okay, yeah.",6,6540
So you know like late dinner and champagne and what not.,6,6541
Were you in Chicago?,6,6542
Mm-hmm.,6,6543
"Downtown, was it beautiful? of course it was beautiful",1,6544
yeah--,6,6545
"so beautiful, full moon.",1,6546
"What a guy.  I can't believe it.  So okay, so do you know any details?  When's it going to be?  Anything?",5,6547
I don't know.  I guess next summer.,6,6548
Am I in it?,5,6549
"Yeah.  Yeah, of course.",6,6550
"Okay, I certainly hope so, of course.",6,6551
So next fall I guess.,6,6552
Next fall.,6,6553
"Yeah, I like the autumn.",1,6554
Are you going to do it in town or are you out of town?,6,6555
"oh, We'll do it in town.",6,6556
"Oh, okay.",6,298
"Yeah, his family doesn't live too far away, so I think-",6,6557
"Yeah, where's he from again?",5,6558
He's from Chicago as well.,6,6559
"Oh he is, okay.",6,6560
Yeah.,6,2
"Cool, perfect.  Another Chicagoite, got to love it.",1,6561
"It's so weird too, right, that like you can grow up so near somebody and never know them until you travel hundreds of miles away.",6,6562
Yeah.,6,2
"Exactly, yeah.  I can't believe you met him in Africa.",5,6563
I know,6,6564
"And the chances, what are the chances of meeting somebody in Africa and then coming back to Chicago?",6,6565
"Right, being like oh, where are you from?  The U.S.  Where in the U.S.?  Chicago.  Where in Chicago?",5,6566
[LAUGHTER] I am sil,4,6567
"Knowing the neighborhood.  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.",6,6568
And now you're getting married.,5,6569
Yeah.,6,2
That is amazing.  You must be so excited.  Did you tell your mom?,5,6570
Mm-hmm.,6,6543
"Oh, did she cry?",5,6571
"Yeah, she loves him.",1,6572
"I knew it.  I knew it, of course she does.  How could you not love Mr. Peace Corps worker man?  He's the nicest guy ever.",5,6573
"Yeah, she-yeah, that's my type.",6,6574
[BREATHING],6,428
you.. I can't believe it.  I'm so happy for you.  This is exactly what you wanted.  It's your dream come true.,1,6575
Thank you.,6,247
"The exact right guy, I fully approve.  He's a wonderful guy.  We have a great time.  He can drink.  That's awesome.",1,6576
[LAUGHTER],6,452
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"Yeah, we all have to hang out now.",6,6577
"Of course, of course she will ... of course she will.  Yeah, don't go and disappear like everyone else after they get married and I never see them again.  That'll make me mad.  You don't want to make me mad.  You know how I get when I get mad.",3,6578
No.,6,136
No.,6,136
"I mean, I I have I have some duty to the man I was going to marry if nobody else came up.",6,6579
Exactly.,6,6580
"Exactly, ""laugh"".",6,6581
Sorry.,0,6530
"ahh I was always worried you'd be a little bit jealous of me, but I was never quite that lucky.",4,6582
There's still time for that.,6,6583
"Oh, thanks. move here before you get married [LAUGHTER]",6,6584
[BREATHING],6,428
"Perfect, okay, good. ""sigh""",6,6585
"I don't feel so bad then.  Well, I'm excited for you.",0,6586
I know. I can't believe it.,5,6587
I can't believe it.,5,6588
I am very excited,1,6589
Who else have you told?,6,6590
Just a few people.,6,6591
Really?,5,123
Just close friends so far.,6,6592
So I was one of the first ones? That makes me feel so important.,1,6593
Yeah.,6,2
I have to think about moving now.  We're going to move in together,6,6594
"Oh yeah, of course.",6,6595
I think it's a good idea to live together before you get married.,1,6596
"I think so, too.  Are you going to get a house or-",6,6597
"I don't want a house, I mean just-",3,6598
No?,5,6599
L.A. apartment is fine.,6,6600
"Oh, nice.",1,6601
yeah.,6,3071
A good apartment. [BREATHING],6,6602
"Two artists, though.  We're bound to be poor forever.",0,6603
"Yeah, how are you going to survive?",6,6604
Exactly. Are you going to have kids?,5,6605
"Yeah, I think so.  I mean, not for a while.",6,6606
yeah.,6,3071
yeah.,6,3071
Definitely not for a while,6,6607
yeah.,6,3071
"So now, I'm going to have to find somebody else to bear my children.",0,6608
[LAUGHTER] Good luck.,6,6609
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"Oh, thanks.  I'll need it.",6,6610
"You won't have trouble, You won't have trouble.",6,6611
"Oh thanks, you're too nice",1,6612
just being polite now,6,6613
"You should just approach her like that.  Hey, will you bear my children?",6,6614
because I am not getting married.,0,6615
"Exactly, [LAUGHTER] I think that'll go over great, don't you?",6,6616
"Yeah, totally.",6,2632
"That's what girls like, right?",6,6617
Total turn on.,6,6618
Would you mind popping out a few for me?,6,6619
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"That'd be great, thanks.",1,6620
"Brian, I need help.",0,6621
"Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.",0,6622
I don't--I'm just--I'm thinking maybe I should move back home or something.  I don't I don't know what to do.  I can't - I cant keep living the way I'm living.,0,6623
"Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?",6,6624
"I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.",5,6625
"I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.",0,6626
How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?,5,6627
I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.,1,6628
"I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.",6,6629
Nothing's impossible.,6,6630
It's not fair.,3,31
You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and,6,6631
That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.,0,6632
I,4,6633
"I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.",6,6634
"No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.",6,6635
I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.,0,6636
"and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.",6,6637
"I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.",6,6638
"Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.",6,6639
"Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?",6,6640
"Well, of course not--",6,6641
"[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--",6,6642
This is humiliating.,6,6643
"Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.",6,6644
"No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.",6,6645
"Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?",6,6646
I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.,6,6647
Have you?  There's got to be something else.,5,6648
Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.,0,6649
"I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.",0,6650
I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.,4,6651
"Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?",5,6652
"If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.",6,6653
I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.,0,6654
"Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.",4,6655
But that doesn't help me when I'm hungry now.,0,6656
"Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.",6,6657
I'm just worried.,4,6658
"Of course, you're worried.  We're all worried.  I'm worried for you.  Everyone's always worried.  You know, I don't-maybe I have a job and yeah, it's a good job whatever and I'm happy, but it doesn't mean I'm going to have it tomorrow or the next day.  You never know what's going to happen.  Something crazy could happen tomorrow.	Something crazy can happen for you tomorrow and you'll get a job.  You never know.  You can walk up to somebody on the street and it'll be something great.  You've just got to be positive.  You're so negative all the time.",4,6659
It's three years.,6,6660
"I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.",6,6661
Is that honestly what you think?,5,6662
"It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-",3,6663
That's really hard to hear.,6,6664
"But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.",6,6665
I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.,6,6666
"Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.",6,6667
"Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.",0,6668
You can.,6,6669
"No, no, really, if I can't pay to live somewhere, I'm going to end up living in my car.",6,6670
You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.,3,6671
I just-- I,6,6672
"You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.",6,6673
"Well, thank you.",6,6674
But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.,6,6675
"Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.",6,6676
"And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?",3,6677
I don't know.,5,257
I mean are you going in for interviews?,5,6678
"Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--",1,6679
Are you presenting-,6,6680
charismatic.,1,6681
putting your best foot forward? or you,6,6682
"yah, to-totally, and I'm not--",6,6683
"Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?",6,6684
"Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.",6,6685
Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?,6,6686
"Yeah, I follow up.",6,6687
Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?,6,6688
It's just like- it's a matter of-,6,6689
"not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.",0,6690
"Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?",6,6691
"I mean, anything.",6,6692
Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?,4,6693
"Well, I'd like to be a working actor.",1,6694
Of course.,6,6695
But um--,6,6696
"Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.",6,6697
Yeah.,6,2
So what's the something else?,6,6698
"Bartending, catering.",6,6699
"You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.",5,6700
Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.,3,6701
If I- If you- Will you stick with it?,4,6702
yeah.,6,3071
"Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.",6,6703
Thank you.,6,247
"But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?",6,6704
"I will, I will.",6,6705
"Yeah, thank you.",1,6706
You know I'll always help you.,6,6707
"Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.",6,6708
"Okay, what flight were you on?",3,6709
Um-Seventeen. Coming from --,6,6710
On what airline?,6,6711
It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.,6,6712
"From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?",6,6713
"Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.",6,6714
So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.,6,6715
Right.,6,533
Yeah.,6,2
"Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-",6,6716
It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-,5,6717
That's good.,1,6718
But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh,6,6719
I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.,6,6720
"Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?",6,6721
"Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.",5,6722
"Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?",6,6723
"Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?",6,6724
"Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.",6,6725
"Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?",6,6726
Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.,6,6727
And you couldn't find it?,5,6728
"No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.",6,6729
Are you sure?,5,6730
I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--,6,6731
"Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.",6,6732
Okay.,6,185
"All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?",6,6733
"Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--",6,6734
Sentimental value.,6,6735
#NAME?,6,1025
"Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.",6,6736
"That's not going to cut it. Like, Really, I really need to get this bag back.",6,6737
"No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.",6,6738
Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?,5,6739
"Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?",5,6740
Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.,5,6741
"Well,",6,2053
Obviously ma'am.,6,6742
"I am sorry, ma'am.",0,6743
"Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.",6,6744
"Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?",5,6745
"No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?",5,6746
"Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?",6,6747
"Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.",1,6748
"Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?",6,6749
"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",1,6750
That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,6,6751
"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",6,6752
"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",6,6753
"Right. Yes, ma'am.",6,6754
And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,6,6755
"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",6,6756
"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",5,6757
"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",5,6758
No.,6,136
"Well, my hands are really tied then.",6,6759
Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,5,6760
"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",6,6761
"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",6,6762
"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",6,6763
Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,0,6764
"Uh, so it was really heavy.",6,6765
"So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.",0,6766
"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",6,6767
There's nothing else you can do?,6,6768
"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",0,6769
I don't believe that for a second.,5,6770
Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,5,6771
"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",6,6772
"No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.",6,6773
"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-",6,6774
What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?,5,6775
makes up?,5,6776
You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,6,6777
"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",6,6778
You could go into the computer and- you know- print-,6,6779
I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.,6,6780
"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",6,6781
"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",6,6782
And you have no guarantee.,6,6783
"I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",6,6784
This is ridiculous.,6,2384
How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,3,6785
"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",6,6786
"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",6,6787
"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",3,6788
"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",6,6789
"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",6,6790
Right.,6,533
It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,6,6791
"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",0,6792
"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",0,6793
okay fine.,3,6794
So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?,6,6795
"Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.",6,6796
"Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.",6,6797
Thanks.,6,1839
You have a wonderful day.,1,6798
What's wrong Melissa?,3,6799
A good friend of mine passed away the other day.,0,6800
"Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?",0,6801
"Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,",6,6802
"metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-",6,6803
That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?,6,6804
Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.,5,6805
[BREATHING],6,428
"I am so sorry,  It's-",0,6806
It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?,6,6807
Kind of.,6,6808
"It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.",0,6809
"Absolutely, absolutely.",6,6810
It's the think,6,6811
"I just, I don't know.",5,6812
There's no reason for it.,3,6813
I know.,6,39
And he could of...  He was pretty awesome,5,6814
Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?,5,6815
"Uh,  We grew up together.",6,6816
yeah.,6,3071
"Is he an actor too, or-?",6,6817
"Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.",6,6818
"I feel really bad for his family, you know.",0,6819
"Yes of course, of course.",6,6820
"It must be really, really hard to lose a child.",0,6821
Was he very close to his family?,6,6822
"Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-",1,6823
yeah.,6,3071
[BREATHING],6,428
I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.,5,6824
Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.,6,6825
"Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.",0,6826
"Of course. If there's anything I can do, you just let me know.  Okay?",6,6827
Thank you.,6,247
Of course.,6,6695
Is there a funeral planned? or-,6,6828
"Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.",6,6829
"Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.",6,6830
Thanks.,6,1839
No problem.,6,6831
"It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...",5,6832
something happens and they die and it's like-,6,6833
"really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.",5,6834
"Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.",6,6835
yeah.,6,3071
[BREATHING],6,428
"Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.",6,6836
yeah.,6,3071
That's the best way to put it.,6,6837
It's hard to say good-bye.,0,6838
Absolutely.,6,6839
[BREATHING],6,428
"Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.",0,6840
[LAUGHTER],6,452
yeah yeah.,6,6841
So guess what.,6,6842
what,6,6843
I got into college.,1,6844
"Shut up.  What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please",3,6845
U.S.C..,6,2617
"Oh, sweet.",1,6846
yeah.,6,3071
So you're not going to leave me.,3,6847
No.,6,136
"oh, good good good good good good.",1,6848
I'll stay in town.,1,6849
Are you going to live on campus?  Where are you going to live?,5,6850
Uh- I don't know.,5,6851
Uh! stay over here.  Like travel to school. because you are so close to me,1,6852
"Well, I don't want to, I don't want to live with my mom.",0,6853
"Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right,  right.  Maybe we should get a place together.",6,6854
Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live?,5,6855
That'll be awesome.,1,1873
"I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so.",0,6856
That's fine.  You don't have to go to school to live near U.S.C..,6,6857
I know.,6,39
But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.,1,6858
Fair enough.,6,6859
"Whoa, this is going to be so much fun.",1,6860
it is going to be so much fun. Yes.,1,6861
Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.,1,6862
"Thank you. I know, I'm really, really, really excited.",1,6863
"Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C..",1,6864
"I know they have a really, really great program for what I want to do.",1,6865
"You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.",1,6866
Can we for real live together?,6,6867
"Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.",6,6868
awesome.,1,6869
So should we get a place near campus? or-,6,6870
That'll be great. That'll be great.,1,6871
"We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?",6,6872
okay.,5,4368
not yet.,6,6873
"Yeah, me either.",6,6874
"[garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun.",1,6875
That happens. That happens at time,6,6876
yeah.,6,3071
It's going to be ridiculous.  It's going to be so cool.,6,6877
"You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though.",3,6878
I'm not going to make fun of you.,3,6879
I'll have to make money and support us.,6,6880
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean.",6,6881
"Well, yeah, of course, but you're going to be working on your school stuff too, and partying that takes up a lot of time, right, especially at U.S.C., I hear it's a big party college.",6,6882
I- I hear the same.,6,6883
Woo- I I do.,5,6884
"I don't know how I feel about that, but-",0,6885
I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you.,1,6886
oh yeah.,6,3332
oh yeah.,6,3332
You're a wild and crazy woman.,3,6887
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure.",1,6888
"Uh huh, it will be awesome.",1,6889
Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.,1,6890
"Oh, man, I'd have been so mad at you.  I'd have been so mad at you, because, what could I have done,",3,6891
"living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.",0,6892
[LAUGHTER] by yourself.,6,6893
you'd be that kid,6,6894
"living near campus, and not going to school.",0,6895
"Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.",1,6896
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"Oh, it's going to be so much fun.",1,6897
yeah.,6,3071
"Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have-",1,6898
We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.,6,6899
That's a good idea.,1,6900
Let's go tomorrow.,6,6901
"Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow-",6,6902
yeah.,6,3071
"Good.  We'll have to have one soon, you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months.",6,6903
Woo-,5,6904
"Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage]",6,6905
exciting.,1,6906
"Hi, sir.  How can I help you?",0,6907
"Oh, thank God.  Do you know how long I've been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being.",5,6908
"All I want to do is put my, pay for my freaking credit card, and there's something wrong in my bill, Like I swear, it says I didn't paid last month, but I know I paid last month.",3,6909
Okay.,6,185
"I put- I've been typing my number in millions of times, it won't listen to me, it's not working, and I can't get a single human being, and finally-",0,6910
"you are a real human being.  Thank you very, very much.",1,6911
"[LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.",6,6912
"This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me.",5,6913
"I kwon, it is ridiculous",3,6914
"yeah, I understand.",6,6915
"Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being.",3,6916
Uh- when's when's-,6,6917
Sir-,6,3877
"If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.",6,6918
"Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine.  Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong.",4,6919
"Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.",0,6920
"Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?",3,6921
I got it in the mail.,6,6922
In the mail?,5,6923
yeah,6,3082
"So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?",6,6924
"Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-",6,6925
Okay.,6,185
"like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.",6,6926
Okay.,6,185
All right. I-,6,6927
"Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...",6,6928
Okay.,6,185
if I call it up on the screen.,6,6929
"Okay, great, go ahead.",6,6930
"So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?",6,6931
It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.,6,6932
"Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-",6,6933
Wow.  I can't believe you're actually admitting to having a problem on your end.  That's a first.,5,6934
"Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-",6,6935
"No, No, No, I am grateful.",1,6936
Absolutely.,6,6839
"Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.",6,6937
Did they take-,6,6938
"You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?",6,6939
"Yes, yes, exactly.",6,6940
Yeah so- That --that did go through.,6,6941
Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?,6,6942
"Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.",6,6943
Because I paid it on time.,6,6944
"Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.",6,6945
Right.,6,533
"Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.",6,6946
Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.,6,6947
Really?,5,123
yeah.,6,3071
"That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.",6,6948
No problem.,6,6831
"thank you, what's the number?",5,6949
ahh one eight hundred three two three,6,6950
three two three,6,6951
six four nine four,6,6952
"six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much.",1,6953
"Yep, So--",6,6954
You're welcome,6,6955
oh.,6,3072
I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.,0,6956
"It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely",4,6957
I am glad.,1,6958
Have a good day.,6,6959
"You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day.",1,6960
bye bye,0,6961
bye,0,6962
What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,6,6963
He saw it.,6,318
How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,5,5357
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
"Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.",5,6964
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,5,1951
I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.,5,6965
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,6,6966
He cried hard.,0,6967
I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,4,1955
He is thinking about him again.,6,6968
"It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.",6,6969
"I guess, he is.",6,6970
What's the meaning of that?,6,6971
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.,4,6972
What?,5,328
Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,6,6973
"What do you mean, dishonest?",3,3444
"You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?",6,6974
"What are you going to do, argue with him?",3,6975
"No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.",6,6976
"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?",4,6977
You can't just say that to him.,6,6978
We have to say it to him!,3,6979
"How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?",6,6980
"For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!",5,6981
"To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?",6,6982
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,6153
"The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--",6,6983
"All right, All right mom.  Listen!",6,6984
"You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?",5,6985
why?,5,6986
You know.,6,344
Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?,6,6987
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1,346
"Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris.",6,6988
You know that's not just my business.,6,6989
"What- What am - what are you going to do, I mean you're old enough to make up your own mind?",5,6990
So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?,6,6991
Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them,6,6992
Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?,3,6993
"You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things!",3,6994
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,6,6162
She's not Larry's girl!,5,6995
"As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.",6,6996
"Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.",6,6997
"I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",3,6998
"Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.",6,6999
To hell with that!,3,7000
Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?,6,7001
I want to get this settled first.,0,7002
"Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?",6,7003
"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",6,7004
"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",6,7005
"So what, I'm not fast with women.",6,1991
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,4475
Because it is.,6,370
"well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.",6,7006
"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?",5,7007
"No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.",6,7008
"You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",3,7009
"All right, then, Mom.",6,7010
Give it some more thought.,6,1217
"I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.",6,7011
What the hell is this?,3,383
"I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?",6,7012
Are you crazy?,3,385
"I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.",0,7013
Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?,6,7014
The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?,5,7015
Must you be inspired?,6,2005
"Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?",1,7016
"Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!",3,7017
Then help me stay here.,6,395
"All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",3,7018
I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.,6,7019
"All right, but don't think like that.",6,7020
I am thinking like that.,6,1235
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,4,401
"Yeah, I can see that.",6,6187
Why did you invite her here?,5,3521
Why does that bother you?,3,404
She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?,5,7021
Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,6,7022
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,407
"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",3,7023
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
How do you know he is even thinking about it?,5,7024
It's got that about it.,6,412
"Well, so what.",6,7025
"What's going on here, Joe?",5,2022
"Now, listen, Kate, just-",3,7026
She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,6,7027
You can't read her mind.,6,417
"She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",5,7028
How do you know why she's waited?,5,2026
Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.,6,7029
Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?,1,7030
"Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.",4,7031
What do you want me to do? What do you want--,3,7032
I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,3,7033
"But, Kate...",6,7034
"Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.",4,7035
[LAUGHTER],6,452
"Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",6,7036
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",0,5428
Calm yourself!,3,7037
"Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",6,7038
"All right, all right.  Calm yourself.",6,7039
"You above all, have got to believe, Joe.",6,7040
"Why me, above all?",5,3544
You've got to believe. You've got to--,5,7041
What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!,4,7042
I can't help it!,3,7043
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",3,435
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,6,2044
I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?,6,7044
"No, it's good.",1,7045
It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.,1,7046
So you're not sorry you came?,5,6210
No.  But I'm not going to stay.,0,7047
Why?,5,343
Well your mother has much as told me to leave.,6,7048
Well--,6,7049
"Well, you saw that! And you.  You've been-",5,7050
What?,5,328
Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.,6,7051
Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,7052
I figured they would- your mother at least.,6,7053
How did you know?,5,3563
"Well, from her point of view why else would I come?",6,7054
"Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.",6,7055
I guess this is why I came.,6,2821
"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!",1,7056
"I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.",5,7057
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",0,7058
"Chris, I've been ready for a long time.",6,7059
"Then, he's gone forever-you're sure?",5,7060
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me.,6,461
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Every day since.,6,463
"Annie, why didn't you say something to me?",3,7061
Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.,5,7062
"Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-",6,7063
Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.,5,7064
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!,5,7065
"Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1,7066
"Not like that, you're not.",6,3587
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?",6,7067
Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.,0,7068
"No, what is it, your mother?",3,7069
"No, nothing like that.",6,5458
"What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.",6,7070
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",6,2075
I don't know how to start.,4,2077
It wouldn't work like this.,6,483
"It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-",6,7071
Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.,5,7072
yeah sure.,6,7073
Yeah.  I lost them.,0,7074
how many?,5,7075
just about all.,6,7076
Oh gee.,5,7077
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,6,7078
"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",6,7079
"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",6,7080
I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,3,7081
"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",3,7082
"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",5,7083
And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,6,7084
And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,5,7085
"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",4,7086
And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,6,7087
"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",6,7088
"And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you.",6,7089
Do you still feel like that?,6,7090
"I I want you now, Annie.",6,7091
"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",3,7092
"Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",1,7093
What would I do with a fortune?,3,504
"What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--",5,7094
actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?,4,7095
Fine.,3,507
"Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?",5,7096
"Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",5,7097
What flashlight?,5,513
"The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?",5,7098
It's not your flashlight.,6,4592
Whose is it?,5,516
It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.,6,7099
"Well, Sure.",6,7100
"I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?",6,7101
"No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?",5,7102
"Well, I hope the moon stays out.  Well, I wonder do they always wander during a full moon?  I can't remember, wasn't it full last year?  Do you remember?",5,7103
yes.,6,7104
"Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?",5,7105
"I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.",5,7106
[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around,5,7107
I am cold.,0,7108
you want my jacket?,5,7109
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",6,1348
"Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here, what's the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave.",5,7110
There is no point in coming out here.,6,7111
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
That's my point too.,6,1350
So let's go.,6,2864
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",3,7112
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I just don't.,6,7113
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",1,7114
"Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.",5,7115
"Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.",5,7116
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.",6,7117
This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah,1,7118
"What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.",5,7119
Yeah they do.,6,545
Augie.,6,4615
"Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.",6,7120
There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.,5,7121
I am just not.,6,7122
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
"I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.",5,7123
"Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",6,7124
We weren't in a good spot.,0,2134
We didn't see them the first time either.,5,2135
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things.,6,7125
"Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?",5,7126
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.",1,7127
"Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.",5,7128
It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.,6,7129
"They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.",6,7130
That's the wind.,6,565
"Well, So what do you think?",6,7131
"Well, so?  What do you think?",5,1383
About what?,5,567
What I was just saying.,6,7132
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,7133
"It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach.",6,7134
"I am not the only one, look at all these people.",6,7135
"Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start",1,7136
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.,0,7137
"Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?",3,7138
"God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.",6,7139
What's bugging you?,5,7140
I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.,6,7141
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.",5,7142
"For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.",6,7143
Why not?,6,179
We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.,6,7144
"We miss them twice, it's not ever.",0,7145
"Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.",6,7146
Well We will see them this year.,6,7147
"No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.",4,7148
I thought you wanted to see it.,6,591
"I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.",6,7149
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.",6,7150
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",6,5534
"Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.",6,7151
"When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.",1,7152
"Right, so I am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage.",6,7153
"Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",5,7154
"We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.",6,7155
"And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",1,7156
"Wait a minute, I got it.",6,604
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",4,5555
"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.",6,7157
I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.,6,7158
"Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?",3,7159
No.,6,136
You want me to go get some champagne?,3,1426
No.,6,136
Take off our shoes?,5,2182
No.,6,136
"What, you want me to whisper in your ear?",5,7160
No.,6,136
You want to get married again?,5,1429
No.,6,136
What? What You want a divorce?,5,7161
No no.,6,7162
"A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?",5,7163
No.,6,136
I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.,6,7164
What.  Welcome to the human race.,6,7165
"You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.",5,7166
"No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.",1,7167
Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.,5,7168
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,1438
Yes it is.,6,625
"Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,7169
Right.,6,533
But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.,6,7170
"No, I know me either.",6,5576
"I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.",0,7171
Maybe if you are with somebody else too?,6,7172
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.",0,7173
"For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.",1,7174
Yeah?,5,636
"For heaven's sake, don't you know that?",3,7175
"Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.",6,7176
"Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",6,7177
Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.,6,7178
I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.,5,7179
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.",6,7180
"Well, look what we have got here.",6,7181
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",6,646
"Well, it's not champagne.",6,7182
Well than we don't need glasses.,6,7183
Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?,5,7184
"No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.",6,7185
"Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",4,7186
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Good God.,5,654
You think it's them?,5,7187
I wonder.,5,656
"Freda is the only one who knows we're up here, and she wouldn't call up.",6,7188
It must be them then.,6,658
What will be do?,6,7189
"We're all right, darling, aren't we whatever happens?",6,7190
Now and always my sweet.,1,7191
I don't care then.,6,662
It was bound to happen sooner or later.,6,7192
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,5,2218
"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",4,6323
"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?",5,7193
Behave exquisitely.,6,2221
With the most perfect poise.,6,2957
"Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.",6,7194
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, the things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",4,7195
Um... It's a pity that one can't stay this way forever.,0,7196
"Darling, don't say that.",3,673
"Well, it's true.",6,3795
The whole business is really rather ridiculous.,6,7197
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",6,2228
Meaning exactly that.,6,7198
"What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,7199
Don't laugh at me; I'm serious.,3,7200
"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",3,2966
Who's they?,5,680
"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.",1,7201
"Well, if I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",1,7202
Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].,1,7203
"Well, what if-what happens when our love-",4,7204
"How long will it last, this overbearing love of ours?",6,7205
Who knows?,6,686
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",6,2239
"No, that fire will fade along with our passion.",6,7206
"Oh, dear, shall we like that?",6,2241
It all depends on how well we played.,6,7207
"Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?",6,7208
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",6,2974
"Well, that's rather serious, isn't it?",6,7209
"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",6,7210
"My dear, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",3,7211
"no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --",0,7212
enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.,1,7213
"Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",6,7214
"Elliot, worms don't pop.",6,2978
"I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.",3,7215
"Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",3,7216
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,702
Which particular one?,6,703
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,6,5627
Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,6,7217
"Horrible thing, I hate it.",6,7218
I know.  You threw him out the window into the canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,0,7219
How long did that row last?,6,709
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,7220
"Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom, too.",6,7221
"Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?",6,7222
That was the first time you ever hit me.,5,2262
"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",6,7223
And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,6,7224
[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.,6,7225
"Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous",6,7226
"Oh, we were very much younger then.",6,7227
And very much sillier.,1,723
"Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,7228
You knew there was nothing.,5,7229
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,2267
You knew there was nothing in that.,5,2990
I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,1,7230
Only a trivial little broach.,6,7231
"I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,7232
"No, not at all.  I-I still have it.  I wear it quite often.",6,7233
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,7234
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",6,5641
"maybe just a little, but--",6,7235
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,6,2275
And what of it?,5,7236
What of it?,5,732
"Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.",1,7237
What about me?,4,734
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious, you never would have heard about it.",6,7238
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",1,2279
I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.,0,7239
"So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?",0,7240
No.,6,136
I'll have a little I think.,6,4774
I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.,5,7241
"No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones.",6,7242
"Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.",6,7243
You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.,6,7244
It's becoming a habit with you.,6,7245
You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,6,7246
Don't be so stupid.,3,2289
"Really, Amanda.",5,748
"Going out somewhere, dear?",6,3008
Just making myself fascinating for you.,6,5653
"Oh, that reply has broken my heart.",0,7247
It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?,4,7248
"As a matter of fact, that is perfectly true.",6,7249
"No, it's not.",6,7250
"Oh, yes it is.",6,7251
"Oh, Do shut up.",3,7252
It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,6,7253
"Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",6,7254
"Well, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",3,7255
"adder don't snap, they sting.",3,7256
"Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",3,7257

[BREATHING],6,428
Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?,6,7259
"Yes, I did quite a bit.",6,7260
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,6,5662
Mind your own business.,6,766
"You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.",1,7261
"Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.",3,7262
I'm not the least bit drunk.,6,7263
I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.,6,7264
"Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",6,7265
"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?  How about a child of nine?",5,7266
"Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.",3,7267
"Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.",1,7268
"Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.",5,7269
"Oh, very good idea.  I will.",1,7270
Ugh.,6,7271
You better turn that off I think.,6,6381
Why?,5,343
It's very late and it will disturb the people upstairs.,3,7272
There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,6,7273
"Well, there are people downstairs I suppose.",6,7274
They're away in Tunis.,6,2318
It is not time of year for Tunis.,6,7275
Turn it on again.,6,7276
I'll do no such thing.,3,2320
"Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.",3,7277
Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.,4,7278
"Well, do try to control yourself darling.",6,7279
Turn it off.,6,787
You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.,6,7280
Turn it off.,6,787
I- I hate you.,3,7281
Amanda-- Listen- Listen-,6,7282
I hate you.,3,7283
"No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.",6,7284
Very music- amusing indeed.,1,7285
"Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.",1,7286
"You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.",6,7287
"Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.",5,7288
"Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",3,7289
Beast; brute; cad; whore,6,7290
Can I help you?,4,183
"Yes, I'm um- just getting my I.D.  I need a new I.D.",6,7291
"Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..",6,7292
What do you mean?  I filled out my forms and I rushed to get my I.D.,5,7293
"Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.",6,7294
The wrong form?,6,7295
"Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-",4,7296
What's wrong about this form?  It says new I.D. on it.,6,7297
"No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --",6,7298
What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?,5,7299
"Sir, don't get an attitude with me.",3,7300
"I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.",6,7301
"No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.",6,7302
yeah.,6,3071
right.,6,7303
"Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?",5,7304
I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.,5,7305
"Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?",6,7306
"You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.",0,7307
This is ridiculous.  I've been here for forty five minutes. Just standing in this one line. I took fifteen minutes to fill out that form.,6,7308
I know.,6,39
"Sir, you- I mean",6,7309
Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?,6,7310
You can waist as much as you want,6,7311
Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.,6,7312
Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.,6,7313
"I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.",6,7314
Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?,6,7315
"Sir, please don't waste my time.",4,7316
There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.,6,7317
"Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?",3,7318
"They're different forms, we process them all different-",6,7319
"Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.",3,7320
I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.,6,7321
"Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.",4,7322
Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.,6,7323
They're processed differently.,6,7324
That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.,6,7325
"Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.",6,7326
I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.,6,7327
I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.,4,7328
"Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.",3,7329
That's just dumb.,6,7330
But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.,3,7331
I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!,3,7332
"Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.",0,7333
"This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.",3,7334
What is it?,5,3589
"Sweetheart, I've got to tell you something.  I just got a call.  I'm going to Iraq.",6,7335
What?,5,328
"I know it's really crappy timing, but I don't have a choice.",6,7336
"What?  No, you can't!",5,7337
I know. I have to go-,4,7338
You didn't- Did you tell them you have two young children at home?,5,7339
"You think they'd listen to me?  No.  Of course, I told them that.",5,7340
And they didn't care?,3,7341
No.,6,136
I don't know what to do.  I'm - Sorry,0,7342
They can't do that to you.,3,7343
I know.,6,39
"I don't have a choice.  I have to go.  If I don't go, they'll come and take me.",4,7344
"No, we have- There's got to be something you can do.  You can't go.",6,7345
I've tried everything.  I've called everyone I know.  I've tried everything. No one can do anything for me or they won't do anything for me.,6,7346
How long do you have to go for?,6,7347
At least a year.,6,7348
What?,5,328
I know.,6,39
I don't want to -- the kids.  You've got to take care of them.  You've got- you've got to-,6,7349
"tell them about me and show them pictures of me and everything like that, because they are not going to see me for such a long time.  And it's such an important time and I just don't want to miss it.",0,7350
There's got to be something we can do.  You can't just go.,6,7351
I don't know what to-,5,7352
I don't have -- I know.  What are we gonna- What are we- just run away?  What can I do?  Where can we go?,4,7353
Why don't we do that- Can we- Can we just leave the country?,5,7354
Where are we gonna go?,5,7355
Where are we gonna go?,5,7355
I don't know.,5,257
They'll find me anyway.  You know they will.,6,7356
What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?,6,7357
"They'd put me in jail and then how long- when will I get to see the kids?  What, ten years?  I don't know.",6,7358
"Well, they're so young.",6,7359
I know.  But I'll-I'll send the pictures all the time and I'll write them emails and you can read them the emails that I send them.,6,7360
Where are you gonna be stationed?  What are you gonna be doing?,5,7361
"I'm gonna be in Bagdad, just doing security.",6,7362
"Are you gonna be like in tanks running around?  What- I mean, what does that mean?",5,7363
"Yeah, it's gonna be everything.  I'm gonna be in the front.  I'll be -- it's not gonna be safe.",6,7364
"Oh, my God.",5,3156

"I know.  I know.  I know I know. You're good You're good at what you do, but there's just so much chance involved.",6,7369

Uh-Hmm.,6,7520
"And so I waited there, but nothing came.",0,7521
"Um, okay.  Well, you can fly- file a claim.  Where were you coming from?",6,7522
"I was coming from um the Midwest, like Iowa.",6,7523
"So, within the country, though? umm",6,7524
"Yeah, I know I was in the country.  I mean, it's not that complicated.",6,7525
"Yeah, well the chances of it being lost forever, you know, are slight because -- -- you were in the --",6,7526
"Well, I would hope so.",6,7527
"Well, I mean, you know that happens pretty often that sometimes baggage -- -- gets lost.",6,7528
People lose --,6,7529
forever?,6,7530
yeah.,6,3071
"You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage.",6,7531
Okay.,6,185
"I mean, it's not big or anything like that.  I mean, it's not worth a lot of money or anything.",6,7532
Did you have insurance on your flight?,6,7533
"No.  I mean, don't you get insurance when you buy your ticket or something?",3,7534
"No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra.",6,7535
"Well, no one even told me about that.  Like, why would I think to buy insurance?  I was- It's like a three hour flight.",5,7536
"well, it's something that worth",1,7537
"yeah, I don't know.",5,7538
"How can you lose my luggage like from like, in --",6,7539
Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.,6,7540
#NAME?,5,1025
"I should hope so.  You know, I need that today.",6,7541
"Um, well, there's not much I can do.  I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in.",6,7542
"Let me explain to you what the problem is.  My grandfather's remains are in that bag.  And I have to, like, distribute them today.  We're suppose to, you know, throw them out to the sea today.",6,7543
wow.,5,7544
"Wow.  Well, that's really important, obviously.  But, um --",5,7545
"Yeah.  I mean, if you have a suggestion, like, it would be great to help me out here.",1,7546
"Uh- Actually, I don't know that that's legal. Um- it is the issue",6,7547
"Well, I don't care if it's legal.  It's happened.  It's already done.",6,7548
"Yeah I mean, Your bag might have been confiscated because it's --",6,7549
"Well, could you tell me if it's been confiscated then.",6,7550
-- it's a biohazard. so- um,6,7551
"I mean, some information here would be great.  Some help.  Can you, like, type something in and find out?",6,7552
Yeah.  Let me just call security.,6,7553
That would be great.  Thank you very much.,1,7554
[LAUGHTER] Okay.  Hold on.,6,7555

"Ryan, what's wrong?",3,7556
I just got some bad news.,6,7557
What?,5,328
"My friend, Shotty, passed away.",0,7558
"Oh, I'm so sorry",0,7559
"The end, he's been sick for awhile.  He had cancer.",0,7560
"Oh, my gosh.",5,7561
"Yeah.  It's just, I never thought it would actually happen, you know? I mean- He's such a fighter and he's always so positive about everything.",5,7562
Yeah.,6,2
"You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --",3,7563
"he wanted to travel, you know.  And he's so talented.  Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life.",1,7564
Yeah.,6,2
What did he do?,5,7565
"He was a designer, you know.  But he did everything. You know, He painted and he- and he did costume design, he did set design, he did lighting, he was --",6,7566
"he just did everything.  He was literally, literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life.",5,7567
And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.,5,7568
Yeah.  I'm so sorry.,0,7569
"I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then --",6,7570
"you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time.",6,7571
You guys have been-,6,7572
"And now I don't have that person anymore, you know.  And it's -- -- it's just, you.",6,7573
Yeah.,6,2
"You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -",6,7574
"and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-",6,7575
I'm sorry. I-,0,7576
"You always think, you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen, like, it will all be better when I am older, you know?",6,7577
"And I don't know why people don't just tell you off the bat that it's just gonna suck anyway.  You know, like, what's the point?",6,7578
"All the best people die, all the bad people live and they make life shitty for you anyway.",6,7579
"Wow, Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that.",5,7580
"No, you're right.  I don't.  You're right.",6,7581
"Even, yeah -- he doesn't he would never feel that way, he would never want me to feel that way.  Of course not, but that's just where I am right now and -- -- I don't know what else to do with it.",6,7582
Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.,0,7583
I just miss him.,0,7584
If there's anything I can do to be there for you.,6,7585
Thanks.,6,1839
Guess what?,3,7383

I got it.  I got accepted to U.S.C..,1,7586
"Oh, for real?",5,7587
Yes! I just found out today.  I just got the letter.,5,7588
That's awesome!,1,7589
"oh,I'm so glad.",1,7590
I know. I know.  I'm so excited.,1,7591
What are you gonna study?,3,7592
"oh, Theater. yeah, yeah.",6,7593
Really? Are you doing the M.F.A. program?,5,7594
yes.,6,7104
"Oh, my gosh.",5,7561
oh-,5,3154
I heard it's so tough to get into.,4,7595
It's exactly what I wanted.,6,7596
"Oh, of course.  No.  I didn't know it was that tough.  I'm just happy that I made it.",1,7597
That's awesome.,1,5201
"I worked really hard, I'll say, I worked really hard. You know, I I'm not bragging or anything like that. But-",6,7598
"Yeah, that's awesome.",1,7599
No.,6,136
"No, No, I'm really looking forward to it.  You know how long -- I have been talking about this forever, right? right?",6,7600
"Uh huh.  Yes, seriously, for years.",5,7601
"Finally.  I'm so excited.  We're gonna -- well, I'll be here.  We're still gonna be able to see each other.",1,7602
I know.  I know.  I'm- I'm definitely -- I realize [LAUGHTER].,5,7603
"We're gonna hang out, right?",1,7604
"What are you, wait, what are you doing?",6,7605
"Um- I'm gonna be studying at U.S.C., too.",1,7606
"Perfect!  Oh, my God.  Are you staying, are you going to live on campus?",5,7607
"Not on campus, but um- I probably won't live too far.  Maybe, I don't know, I might go to Silver Lake or something.",6,7608
We are gonna party all the time.,6,7609
Yeah.  Totally- Well where are you going to live?,5,7610
We are gonna have a great time.,1,7611
"[garbage] I'm going to live on campus.  I mean, well, around campus, anyway.  Yeah, housing around campus.",6,7612
Oh yeah.,6,7613
Good tradeoff,6,7614
"I just want to be really close to things, you know.  I know it's not exactly the best neighborhood in the entire world. But uh-",6,7615
I don't- I don't think it's that bad.,6,7616
"I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway.",6,7617
yeah.,6,3071
"They don't live here.  They don't know, right?",6,7618
"Yeah. I think it's really also if you- if you consider yourself like, us and them, kind of thing- If you think you're part of your community then --you going to like it more",1,7619
yeah.,6,3071
Exactly.  You make it what you make it. You know? Right? And I'm gonna make it so freaking awesome.,6,7620
"Right, Exactly.",6,7621
Oh I'm so glad.,1,7622
yeah.,6,3071
"So when do you know, like, where you're gonna live? and-",6,7623
"Well, I don't know.  I've got to go look for a place.",6,7624
"Oh, wow.",5,7625
"Yeah, yeah.  I- I don't- I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?",6,7626
Um-,6,7627
You know the area better than I do.,6,7628
"Yeah.  I mean, I know, I know, like the- the housing surrounding the campus pretty well.",6,7629
"yeah, yeah?",5,7630
Um- How many people do you want to live with?,6,7631
"Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?",6,7632
All dudes?,5,7633
I don't care. I don't care.,3,7634
Um- I think I have some friends.,6,7635
yeah?,5,7636
yeah.,6,3071
That would be perfect.,6,7637
"There's actually, a friend of mine is um- moving out of her place and her place is amazing-- And it's really cheap.",5,7638
Really?,5,123
Really?,5,123
yeah.,6,3071
Cheap is exactly what I need- Because I have no money at all.,6,7639
Okay.,6,185
Okay.,6,185
"But, uh--",6,7640
How are you going to pay for school? Did- did you--?,5,7641
"Loans, scholarships, I've got a lot of scholarships-- Yeah, yeah. I'm- I'm half Native American so I get all those scholarships, too. yeah.",6,7642
"You've got a lot- oh, awesome.",1,7643
Oh cool.,1,7644
"So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so.",6,7645
Yeah.,6,2
"That helps, right?  Get some academic scholarships. And uh-",1,7646
totally.,6,7647
good for you.,1,7648
"And yeah, well, I mean, basically I just applied for any and every possible scholarship and grant that could come by, so I can go.",6,7649
the way to do it.,6,7650
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's gonna work out.  I'm gonna be able to pay for it, I'm gonna go, I mean, I'll have a little debt in the end.  But I don't care.",6,7651
"Wow, are you so excited?",5,7652
Right.,6,533
It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true?,5,7653
"You're gonna be so busy, too. You're going to have to work so hard.",0,7654
"Oh I know, I know.",6,7655
"But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right?",6,7656
Oh good.,1,7657
Oh totally.,5,7658
Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy.,1,7659
All right.  Wow.  So exciting.,5,7660
I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.,1,7661
We'll have fun.,1,7662
Yeah.  We'll have so much fun.,1,7663
Great.  Okay.,1,7664
cool,6,7665
"D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?",6,7666
"Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.",6,7667
This happens every two weeks?,6,7668
Yeah.  That my service just goes out.,6,7669
You've lost your connection.,0,7670
yeah.,6,3071
okay.,5,4368
"And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-",6,7671
Hmm.  Mmm.,6,7672
"Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.",6,7673
Has somebody tried to pin your site?,6,7674
"Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.",6,7675
"Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?",6,7676
"Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.",6,7677
Okay.,6,185
"Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?",6,7678
Hmm. Mmm.,6,7679
"Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --",6,7680
yeah.,6,3071
"It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.",6,7681
"Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.",4,7682
Oh really?,5,262
"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.",6,7683
"Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --",6,7684
"Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?",6,7685
Uh huh.,6,119
"Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.",6,7686
All right.,6,1365
Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?,6,7687
"Yeah, I see that.",6,7688
"Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list.",6,7689
Okay.,6,185
And hit enter.,6,7690
Okay.,6,185
Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?,5,7691
"Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.",6,7692
"Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.",6,7693
"Uh huh, Okay.",6,7694
Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?,5,7695
"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.",6,7696
"It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",6,7697
Okay.,6,185
"what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week?",6,7698
"Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --",6,7699
Wow.  That would be amazing.  Really?,5,7700
"Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.",3,7701
"Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.",5,7702
I completely understand.,6,7703
It's so frustrating.,0,7704
Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.,3,7705
Thank you so much.,1,7706
Absolutely.  It's a new service we are offering.,6,7707
"Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.",1,7708
Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?,1,7709
"Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.",5,7710
"Great.  Well, that makes me very happy.  That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme.  Is there anything else I can help you with?",1,7711
No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.,1,7712
All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.,1,7713
Okay.  Thanks.,6,7714
"All right.  Bye, bye.",6,7715
What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,6,5356
He saw it.,6,318
When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?,5,7716
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
"I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke.",5,7717
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,5,1951
"I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen.",6,7718
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,6,6966
He cried hard?,5,1954
I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,4,2738
"What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.",6,7719
I guess he is.,6,325
What's the meaning of that?,6,6971
"I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",4,7720
What?,5,328
Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,6,6973
What do you mean dishonest?,3,330
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,6,7721
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",3,1185
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.,6,7722
"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",4,7723
You can't say that to him.,6,335
We have to say it to him.,6,7724
how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?,5,7725
For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!,5,7726
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?",6,7727
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,6153
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",5,7728
"All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?",6,7729
Why?,5,343
You know.,6,344
"Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?",6,7730
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,1,346
"Well, that's your business, Chris.",6,7731
It's not just my business.,6,7732
"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.",6,7733
So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?,6,7734
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't --",6,7735
"Oh, so it isn't just my business?",6,7736
I'm just saying.,6,353
You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.,3,7737
"Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",6,7738
"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",6,7739
She is not Larry's girl!,5,7740
"From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?",6,7741
"I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.",3,7742
"Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that",6,7743
To hell with that!,3,7000
Have you asked Annie yet?,6,2765
I wanted to get this taken care of first.,6,7744
"Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?",4,7745
"Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",6,7746
"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",6,7747
So what?  I'm not fast with women.,5,6169
"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",5,7748
Because it is.,6,370
"Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.",6,7749
"I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",6,7750
"No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.",3,7751
"All right then, mom.",6,7752
Just give it some more thought.,6,380
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",1,7753
"But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",6,7754
What the hell is this?,3,383
"I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.",6,7755
Are you crazy?,3,385
I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,0,7756
"What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?",5,7757
"Yes.  On this, I would.",6,7758
You can't think like that.,6,7759
"Well, you help me stay here.",6,7760
"All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",3,7761
"I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.",6,7762
Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?,3,7763
I am thinking that way.,6,5406
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",4,1236
"Yeah, I can see that.",6,6187
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,6,6140
He saw it.,6,318
"What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",5,7764
He was out here when it broke.,4,320
When?,5,321
About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.,5,7765
What was he doing out here four in the morning?,5,7766
"I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.",6,7767
Did you talk to him?,5,1174
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,6,6966
He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?,6,7768
"Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",4,7769
What?,5,328
Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,6,6973
What do you mean dishonest?,3,330
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,6,7721
"What are you gonna do, argue with him?",3,7770
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean,6,7771
"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?",4,7772
"Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?",5,7773
"For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!",5,7774
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.",6,7775
You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?,6,7776
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,6153
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--",6,7777
"All right.  All right, just listen.",6,7778
"You know why I invited Annie, right?",6,7779
Why?,5,343
You know.,6,344
"Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?",6,1194
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,1,1972
"Well, that's your business, Chris.",6,7731
You know it's not just my business.,6,348
"What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.",3,7780
So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?,6,7781
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't gonna --",6,7782
"So it isn't just my business?  You infuriate me sometime, you know that.",3,7783
"Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",6,7784
"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",6,7739
She's not Larry's girl.,6,356
"As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead.  And she's still his girl.",6,7785
"Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.",6,7786
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",3,7787
"Well, you're a considerate fella.  There's nothing wrong with that.",6,7788
what to hell with that!,3,7789
Have you asked Annie yet?,6,2765
I wanted to get this settled first.,0,363
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.",6,7790
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it seems like she's forgotten him.",6,7791
"I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",6,7792
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,0,367
"So what, I'm not fast with women?",6,7793
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,5,1992
Because it is.,6,370
"Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.",6,7794
"[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,",6,7795
"she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",6,7796
"No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.",3,7797
"Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",3,7798
"All right then, mom.",6,7752
Just give it some more thought.,6,380
"I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.",1,7799
But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.,6,7800
What the hell is this?,3,383
"I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.",6,7801
Are you crazy?,3,385
"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it.",6,7802
But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?,3,7803
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0,388
Must you be inspired?,6,2005
"Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.",1,7804
"I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it?",6,7805
You don't want to think like that.,6,6183
"Well, you help me stay here.",6,7760
"All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.",3,7806
"I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.",6,7807
"Don't think like that, do you hear me?",3,7808
"Well, I am thinking like that.",6,7809
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,400
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",4,1236
"Yeah, I can see that.",6,6187
Why did you invite her here?,5,3521
Why does that bother you?,3,404
"She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?",5,7810
"Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.",6,7811
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,407
"What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.",3,7812
He's not going to marry her.,0,410
Why do you think he's even thinking that?,5,7813
He's got that about it.,6,7814
"Well, so what?",3,2021
"What's going on here, Joe?",5,2022
Now listen.,6,415
"No.  She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",6,7815
You don't know.  You can't read her mind.,5,7816
"Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.",5,7817
How do you know why she's waited?,5,2026
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,7818
"Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?",3,7819
"Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",3,7820
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?",4,7821
"I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.",6,7822
But Kate?,5,7823
"No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!",3,7824
But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.,5,7825
Calm yourself.,6,429
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",0,5428
Calm yourself.,6,429
Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,5,7826
All right.  All right.,6,7827
You above all have got to believe.,6,7828
"What do you mean, me above all?",5,7829
Just don't stop believing.,3,5432
"What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.",4,7830
I can't help it.,0,434
"What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?",5,7831
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,6,2044
"I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it?",6,7832
It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,1,7833
"So, you're not sorry I came?",5,7834
No.  But I'm not going to stay.,0,7047
Why?,5,343
"Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.",6,7835
Well-,6,3557
You saw that.  And well you've been --,6,7836
What?,5,328
You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.,6,7837
"Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.",6,7838
"I figured they would, your mother at least.",6,7839
How did you know?,5,3563
"Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?",3,7840
"Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.",6,7841
"Yes, that's why I came.",6,7842
"Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I",1,7843
"I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God, I'm embarrassing you. I-I didn't want to do this here. I- I wanted to do it someplace different, someplace where we could be new to each other.",5,7844
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.",0,7845
"Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.",6,7846
So he's gone forever then?  You sure?,5,7847
I almost got married two years ago.,1,459
Why didn't you?,5,460
You started to write me.,6,461
You felt something that far back?,5,462
Everyday since.,6,1287
"Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?",3,7848
"Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.",6,7849
"Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a --",6,7850
"oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?",5,7851
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.,5,7852
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1,7853
Not like that you're not.,6,472
I kissed you.,6,473
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?",6,7854
Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.,0,7855
"No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother?",5,7856
"No, nothing like that.",6,5458
You have to tell me.,6,7857
Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,6,7858
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.",6,7859
You have to tell me.,6,7857
I don't I don't know where to start.,6,7860
It wouldn't work like this.,6,483
It's so mixed up with so many other things.,5,7861
"You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company?",4,7862
"Yeah, sure.",6,485
I lost them.,0,7863
How many?,5,487
Just about all.,6,2081
"It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.",6,7864
"For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.",6,7865
I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.,6,7866
"I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",6,7867
"Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?",5,7868
"And and to see that again, to to bring that back on the earth again, like- like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them.",1,7869
It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,5,7870
"I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.",6,7871
So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.,6,7872
"I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",6,7873
"It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,",6,7874
"you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.",6,7875
And I guess that included you.,6,3611
Do you still feel like that?,6,7090
"I want you now, Annie.",6,3613
"Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",6,7876
"And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",6,7877
"Oh, Annie,",5,7878
[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?,4,7879
Annie I am going to make you a fortune.,1,7880
"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?",4,7881
Fine.,3,507
"What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",5,7882
"This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.",5,7883
What flashlight?,5,513
"The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.",5,7884
You mean our flashlight?,5,7885
Well-,6,3557
"I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?",5,7886
"Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.",6,7887
"How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?",5,7888
Yes.,6,192
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.",5,7889
"I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]",5,7890
"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something",5,7891
I'm cold.,0,528
Do you want my jacket?,6,529
It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.,6,7892
"Are you kidding?  We just got here, we'd miss it.  What's the point of coming all the way out here if we're just going to turn around and go home?",5,7893
There is no point in coming out here.,6,7111
Right.,6,533
That's my point.,6,534
"That's my point, too.",6,6256
So let's go.,6,2864
"Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it?",4,7894
Not particularly.,6,538
Why not?,6,179
I just don't.,6,7113
Oh,6,3095
it's stupid.,3,7895
"Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",6,7896
"I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.",6,7897
Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,6,7898
"Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,",1,7899
"and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.",6,7900
"I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.",6,7901
"What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.",5,7902
"Yeah, they do.",6,1360
Augie.,6,4615
"All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.",5,7903
I'm just not.,6,549
For real?,5,550
Yes.,6,192
"I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.",5,7904
"Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.",6,7905
We weren't in a good spot.,0,2134
We didn't see them the first time either.,5,2135
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.,6,7906
"Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.",5,7907
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;",1,7908
somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-,5,7909
"And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,",6,7910
"they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.",1,7911
That's the wind.,6,565
"Well, so what do you think?",6,2145
"Well, so, what do you think?",6,570
About what?,5,567
What I was just saying.,6,7132
It's ridiculous.,6,2147
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,573
It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.,6,7912
"I'm not the only one, look at all these people.",6,7913
"Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",1,7914
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,1392
"I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.",6,7915
"uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?",5,7916
"God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.",3,7917
What's bugging you then?,5,4650
I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.,6,7918
"It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.",4,7919
"For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion.",0,7920
Why not?,6,179
We We don't ever.  Have we ever?,5,7921
We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.,6,7922
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",6,7923
"Well, we'll see them this year.",6,2161
"No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.",1,7924
"Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.",6,7925
You don't understand anything I am saying.,3,592
"No, of course not.",6,2164
I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,6,7926
"I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --",6,7927
"you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.",1,7928
Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,6,7929
"And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",1,7930
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,6,2176
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",4,7931
"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?",6,7932
I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.,6,7933
"Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um, listen.  Do you want to dance?",6,7934
No.,6,136
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,3,612
No.,6,136
Take off our shoes?,5,2182
No.,6,136
"What, you want me to blow in your ear?",3,7935
[LAUGHTER] No.,6,7936
"Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?",5,7937
No.,6,136
No.,6,136
A vacation?,5,618
No.,6,136
"A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?",5,7938
I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,6,7939
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?",6,7940
"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",1,7941
"Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",6,7942
This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,7943
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,7944
Right.,6,533
But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.,6,7945
"Now, I know.  Me either",6,7946
"This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?",6,7947
I'm trying the best I can.,6,7948
"I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.",6,7949
But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.,5,7950
"Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?",6,7951
I didn't say that.,6,157
"No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.",0,7952
"For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.",6,7953
Really?,5,123
"Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.",6,7954
"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",6,6315
"Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",6,7955
"I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.",5,7956
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.",1,7957
"Oh, well look what we've got here.",6,7958
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",6,1457
"Well, it isn't champagne.",6,7959
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",6,2209
Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?,0,7960
"No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.",0,7961
"Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.",4,7962
Or not.,6,653
Or not.,6,653
Oh Good God.,5,7963
Do you think it's them?,5,1462
I wonder.,5,656
"what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",5,7964
Must be them then?,6,7965
What do we do?,4,7966
"We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?",3,7967
"Now and always, my sweet.",1,7968
I don't care then.,6,662
It was bound to happen sooner or later.,6,7192
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,5,2218
"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",4,6323
"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.",5,7969
Behave exquisitely.,6,2221
With the worst- with the most perfect poise?,6,7970
I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.,6,7971
"Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--",5,7972
"things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",4,7973
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,4,2225
"Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.",4,7974
"Well, it's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.",6,7975
"Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.",1,7976
Meaning just that.,6,7977
"Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,7978
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,0,2231
"You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.",3,7979
Who's they?,5,680
"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.",6,7980
uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.,6,7981
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",1,2235
Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.,1,7982
"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",3,7983
[garbage] who knows?,6,7984
"Well, will we always bicker and fight?",3,7985
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,0,4727
"Oh, dear.  Shall we like that?",6,7986
"Well, it depends on how well we played.",6,7987
"What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?",3,7988
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",6,2974
"That's rather serious, isn't it?",6,7989
"No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.",6,7990
"Darling, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",3,7991
"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.",0,7992
"[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.",6,7993
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",6,2251
"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.",6,7994
"Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.",3,7995
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,4,702
Which particular one?,6,703
The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.,6,7996
"Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.",6,7997
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,6,5629
I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,0,7998
How long did that roue last?,6,7999
It went on intermittently for days.,6,710
"Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?",6,8000
"Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.",0,8001
"[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?",6,8002
That was the first time you hit me.,4,8003
"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",6,7223
"And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor, biting and scratching one another. [LAUGHTER]",6,8004
I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],6,8005
"How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous",6,8006
We were very much younger then.,6,722
Very much sillier.,1,1530
"Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden.",6,8007
You knew there was nothing in that.,5,2990
Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.,6,8008
Oh You knew there was nothing in that.,5,8009
I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,1,7230
Only a trivial little broach.,6,7231
"I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.",6,8010
Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.,1,8011
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3,728
"[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",6,8012
You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?,5,8013
"Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.",0,8014
He let him kiss you.  You said you did.,6,8015
"Well, what of it.",3,8016
what of it?,5,8017
Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,1,8018
What about me?,4,734
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.",6,8019
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",1,2279
I'm getting very bored with this conversation.,0,8020
"Me, too, bored stiff.",0,8021
Do you want some brandy?,6,8022
No thanks.,6,3001
I think I'll have a little.,6,8023
I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,5,3799
"No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.",6,8024
"Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.",6,8025
You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.,6,8026
It's becoming a habit with you.,6,7245
You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.,6,8027
Don't be stupid.,3,747
"Amanda, really.",5,8028
What?,5,328
"Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?",5,8029
Just making myself fascinating for you.,6,5653
"Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.",0,8030
"It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?",6,8031
"Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",6,8032
"No, it isn't.",6,2294
"Yes, it is.",6,1561
"No, it it is not, be quiet.",6,8033
It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,6,8034
"hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",5,8035
"oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder.",3,8036
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",3,760
"Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!",3,8037
They sting.,3,1567
They snap.,3,2300
"Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?",3,8038
"So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?",6,8039
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",6,1569
"You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?",6,8040
[LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.,6,8041
"I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.",1,8042
You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.,3,8043
I am not the slightest bit drunk.,6,8044
You always had a weak head.,6,1575
I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,5,8045
"Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",6,8046
"Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?",5,8047
Not- Would you shut up.,3,8048
"You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.",6,8049
"You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy.",6,8050
You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.,1,8051
"You better turn that off, I think.",6,2314
Why?,5,343
Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.,3,8052
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.,6,8053
"Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.",6,8054
They're away in Tunis.,6,2318
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,6,2319
"Turn it on again, please.",6,782
I do I shall do no such thing.,3,8055
Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.,6,8056
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,3,2322
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,3,2323
Turn it off!,3,8057
Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.,3,8058
Very amusing indeed.,1,3038
"You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.",3,8059
Ja! Very funny.,1,8060
"Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.",3,8061
"You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.",6,8062
This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.,3,8063
"Oh, you're not going like this.",6,8064
"Yes, I am. Let go with me",6,8065
"[GARBAGE] No, you're not.",6,8066
"You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!",6,8067
oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.,5,8068
Beast,6,8069
You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.,6,8070
Brute,6,8071
pig,6,8072
