"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",6,0,surprise
"It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--",6,7,disgust
"All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?",5,6,sadness
Why?,5,5,neutral
You know.,6,6,sadness
"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",5,6,sadness
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,6,1,joy
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",6,6,sadness
You know it's not just my business.,6,6,sadness
Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,5,6,sadness
"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",5,6,sadness
Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --,6,6,sadness
Then it's not just my business.,6,6,sadness
I'm just saying.,6,6,sadness
"You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",5,3,anger
Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
She's not Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
"From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.",6,6,sadness
"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.",4,4,fear
"You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.",6,6,sadness
To hell with that.,6,3,anger
I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?,5,5,neutral
I wanted to get this settled first.,6,0,surprise
Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,5,6,sadness
"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",6,6,sadness
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,5,6,sadness
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,6,0,surprise
So what.  I'm not fast with women.,6,5,neutral
Why does it have to be Annie?,5,5,neutral
Because it is.,6,6,sadness
Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.,6,6,sadness
"You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",6,6,sadness
"I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.",5,4,fear
"Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?",5,5,neutral
I don't want a diagram.,6,7,disgust
He thinks he's coming back Chris.,6,6,sadness
"You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...",6,3,anger
...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.,5,5,neutral
"All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]",6,3,anger
Just give it some more thought.,6,6,sadness
"I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.",1,6,sadness
"But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.",6,6,sadness
What the hell is this?,5,3,anger
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",6,6,sadness
Are you crazy?,5,3,anger
"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.",6,6,sadness
You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,5,3,anger
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,5,0,surprise
Oh.  Must you be inspired?,5,5,neutral
"Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.",1,1,joy
"I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.",6,6,sadness
You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?,5,3,anger
"On this, I would.",6,6,sadness
Well you don't want to think like that.,6,7,disgust
Then help me stay here.,6,6,sadness
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",5,3,anger
I know that.  Then just help me stay here.,6,6,sadness
Just don't think like that.,6,6,sadness
Well I am thinking like that.,6,6,sadness
"I don't understand you, do I?",5,5,neutral
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,6,4,fear
I can see that.,6,6,sadness
Why did he invite her here?,5,5,neutral
Why does that bother you?,5,3,anger
"She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden?",5,5,neutral
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,6,6,sadness
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,6,6,sadness
"What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?",5,5,neutral
[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,6,3,anger
He's not going to marry her.,6,0,surprise
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,5,5,neutral
It's got that about it.,6,6,sadness
Oh.  So what.,6,5,neutral
"What is going on here, Joe?",5,5,neutral
Now listen.,6,6,sadness
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,6,6,sadness
You can't read her mind.,6,7,disgust
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",5,5,neutral
How do you know why she waited?,5,5,neutral
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",6,0,surprise
"Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",5,1,joy
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",6,6,sadness
What do you want me to do? What do you want?,5,3,anger
"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",6,6,sadness
I won't stand for any nonsense.,6,3,anger
Kate.,6,6,sadness
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",6,4,fear
[BREATHING],6,7,disgust
Calm yourself.,6,6,sadness
"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",6,6,sadness
Okay. Calm yourself.,6,6,sadness
"I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?",5,6,sadness
"Look at you, you're shaking.",6,4,fear
I can't help it.,6,0,surprise
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",5,3,anger
You're the only one who still loves his parents.,2,6,sadness
"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",5,6,sadness
It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,6,7,disgust
"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.",2,1,joy
You're not sorry you came.,6,0,surprise
"I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.",6,0,surprise
"For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.",6,6,sadness
Well.,6,6,sadness
"And then, you.  You've been kind of...",6,6,sadness
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,6,0,surprise
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.,6,6,sadness
I knew they would.,6,6,sadness
"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",5,5,neutral
"So would you want to?  I mean, I guess you have to know that's kind of why I asked you to come?",5,6,sadness
"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",6,6,sadness
"I love you. Annie, I love you.",2,1,joy
[LAUGHTER],6,6,sadness
"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",6,6,sadness
"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",5,5,neutral
No. No,6,6,sadness
"You feel uncomfortable here, you feel that it's wrong here somehow.  I just...I don't...I didn't want...I didn't want to take you away from anything.",6,4,fear
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.",6,6,sadness
And he's gone forever?  Are you sure?,5,5,neutral
I almost got married two years ago.,6,1,joy
Why didn't you?,5,5,neutral
You started to write me.,6,7,disgust
You felt something that far back?,5,5,neutral
Every day since.,6,6,sadness
Why didn't you let me know?,5,3,anger
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.  And when you did finally write me,",6,6,sadness
Give me a...,6,6,sadness
Give me a kiss.,6,6,sadness
God.  I kissed you Annie.,6,5,neutral
beating around the bush.,6,6,sadness
"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",6,5,neutral
"Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.",1,1,joy
Not like that you're not.,6,6,sadness
I kissed you.,6,7,disgust
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",6,6,sadness
"Chris, what is it?",5,5,neutral
"Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.",5,1,joy
No. What is it?  Is it your mother?,5,5,neutral
No it's nothing like that. It's-,6,6,sadness
"Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",5,7,disgust
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,6,6,sadness
You've got to tell me.,6,6,sadness
I don't even know how to start.,6,6,sadness
It wouldn't work like this.,6,6,sadness
"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?",5,5,neutral
"Yeah, sure.",6,6,sadness
Well I lost them.,6,0,surprise
How many?,5,5,neutral
Pretty much all.,6,6,sadness
"Aw, geez.",6,5,neutral
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,5,6,sadness
"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",6,6,sadness
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",6,3,anger
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.",3,7,disgust
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",6,6,sadness
"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",5,5,neutral
Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.,6,5,neutral
"I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.",2,7,disgust
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,6,6,sadness
Do you still feel that way?,5,6,sadness
I just want you to know Annie.,6,6,sadness
"Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me?",5,6,sadness
"Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",5,3,anger
"Annie, Annie.  I am going to make a fortune for you.",6,1,joy
What would I do with a fortune?,5,3,anger
"What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh.",5,5,neutral
"Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?",5,5,neutral
Fine.,6,3,anger
"Okay.  Is that, is that--",6,6,sadness
No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.,6,6,sadness
"I don't know, probably if you can't tell, though, it's probably not them, right?  It's probably going to be like this unmistakable thing, right?",5,6,sadness
Oh no.  you know what I forgot?,5,5,neutral
"My flashlight.  God, how could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",5,5,neutral
What flashlight?,5,5,neutral
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",5,5,neutral
That's not your flashlight.,6,6,sadness
Whose is it?,5,5,neutral
It's ours; it's my flashlight too.,6,6,sadness
"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",6,6,sadness
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,6,6,sadness
How's that supposed to make me feel?,5,6,sadness
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",6,6,sadness
"Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.",5,5,neutral
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?,5,5,neutral
"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",5,5,neutral
"Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?",5,5,neutral
"God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.",1,5,neutral
I wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,6,5,neutral
I'm cold.,6,0,surprise
Do you want my jacket?,5,6,sadness
"It's after eleven, let's go.",6,6,sadness
What?  We just got here.  What's the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home?,5,5,neutral
There is no point.,6,3,anger
Right.,6,6,sadness
That's my point.,6,6,sadness
"Wait, that's my point, too.",6,6,sadness
"Well, then let's go.",6,6,sadness
"No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",5,4,fear
Not particularly.,6,6,sadness
I just don't.  It's stupid.,6,3,anger
"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",6,6,sadness
"Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.",5,6,sadness
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,6,1,joy
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,6,6,sadness
I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.,1,5,neutral
Yeah they do.,6,6,sadness
Oh Augie,6,5,neutral
"okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs.",6,6,sadness
"There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.",6,5,neutral
I'm just not.,6,6,sadness
For real?,5,5,neutral
"God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",5,5,neutral
"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",1,6,sadness
"Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",6,7,disgust
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,6,0,surprise
Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.,6,5,neutral
"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",6,6,sadness
"Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.",5,5,neutral
"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",6,1,joy
"Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map.",6,6,sadness
"Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.",6,6,sadness
They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.,6,6,sadness
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.,6,6,sadness
And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.,6,6,sadness
"Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm.",6,0,surprise
That's the wind.,6,6,sadness
So what do you think?,5,6,sadness
About what?,5,5,neutral
"About all of that, about all I was talking about.",6,6,sadness
"Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.",6,7,disgust
"Well, so, what do you think?",5,6,sadness
About what I was saying.,6,6,sadness
I think it's ridiculous.,6,7,disgust
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,6,sadness
It's PR! Somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach.,5,5,neutral
"Not just me, look at all of these people.",6,7,disgust
"Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more, it keeps us excited.  We keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot, get in on the action.",1,1,joy
"Are we talking about the same thing, here?",5,6,sadness
"I'm sorry, it's just fish to me.",6,7,disgust
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",5,6,sadness
"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",6,3,anger
"Well then, what's bugging you?",5,3,anger
We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.,6,6,sadness
"There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.",6,7,disgust
"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",6,0,surprise
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?,5,5,neutral
We've missed them twice.,6,6,sadness
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,6,6,sadness
They'll show up this time.,6,6,sadness
No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus.,6,6,sadness
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.,6,1,joy
I thought you wanted to see it.,6,6,sadness
You don't understand anything I am saying.,6,3,anger
No. Of course not.,6,6,sadness
"I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just...",6,6,sadness
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",6,0,surprise
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.",6,6,sadness
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",6,7,disgust
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,6,7,disgust
"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",5,6,sadness
"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",6,6,sadness
Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.,5,5,neutral
"We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.",6,6,sadness
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",2,1,joy
"Wait a minute, I got it.",6,6,sadness
"Drinking champagne from the bottle,",6,6,sadness
"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",6,6,sadness
dancing barefoot in the sand.,6,4,fear
"That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?",5,6,sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,6,6,sadness
Sure.  All right.  Okay.,6,6,sadness
"Listen, do you want to dance?",5,6,sadness
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,5,3,anger
Do you want to take off your shoes?,5,6,sadness
"No, no. Nothing.",6,6,sadness
Then what?,5,5,neutral
Do you want to get married again?,5,0,surprise
What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?,5,5,neutral
A vacation?,5,5,neutral
Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?,5,5,neutral
I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.,6,6,sadness
"Well welcome to the human race, huh?  Do you think I had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish?  No.",5,6,sadness
"No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?",5,1,joy
Do you know what you get?  You get this.,5,5,neutral
This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.,5,5,neutral
Yes it is.,6,6,sadness
Sure.  This is standing on the beach waiting.  This is fighting.,6,6,sadness
Right,6,6,sadness
"I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...",6,6,sadness
Do you understand what I am saying?,5,5,neutral
I'm doing the best I can.,6,6,sadness
"I know you are Augie, I know.",6,6,sadness
"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",6,0,surprise
"Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",6,6,sadness
I just- I know I don't make you happy.,1,0,surprise
"Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",6,3,anger
Yeah?,5,5,neutral
Yeah.  Don't you know that?,5,5,neutral
For Heaven's sake Augie.,6,6,sadness
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",1,6,sadness
"You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",6,6,sadness
"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.",6,5,neutral
"We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?",5,6,sadness
"Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",6,5,neutral
And look what I got here.,6,5,neutral
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",6,6,sadness
It's not champagne.,6,6,sadness
I guess we don't need glasses.,6,6,sadness
Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?,5,5,neutral
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.,6,6,sadness
"Augie, I'm sorry.",6,0,surprise
"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",6,4,fear
Or not.,6,6,sadness
Good God.,6,5,neutral
Is it them?,5,5,neutral
I wonder.,6,5,neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up.,6,6,sadness
It must be them then.,6,6,sadness
It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do?,5,6,sadness
"We are okay, aren't we darling?",5,3,anger
"Now and always, sweet.",2,6,sadness
I don't care then.,6,7,disgust
It had to happen sooner or later.,6,6,sadness
"Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry, what's that?",5,5,neutral
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],6,0,surprise
[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.,6,4,fear
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER],6,4,fear
We'll behave exquisitely.,6,6,sadness
With perfect poise.,6,6,sadness
I think I shall do a curtsy.,6,1,joy
"It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?",5,4,fear
Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy.,1,0,surprise
"Darling, don't say that.",6,3,anger
It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.,6,7,disgust
What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love?,5,5,neutral
Yes.  Meaning just that.,6,6,sadness
"Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,5,neutral
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.,6,0,surprise
"Oh darling, you mustn't be serious.  It's just what they want.",6,6,sadness
Who's they?,5,5,neutral
"All of those futile moralists who make life unbearable.  You have to laugh at them, be flippant.",6,6,sadness
"You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness.",2,6,sadness
"you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too.",6,1,joy
Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right.,6,1,joy
"How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours?",5,3,anger
Who knows?,5,6,sadness
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,5,3,anger
Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,6,0,surprise
"Oh dear, should we like that?",5,5,neutral
Well it depends on how well we've played.,6,6,sadness
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?,5,6,sadness
Yes.  Yes with all of his might.,6,6,sadness
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",5,3,anger
"No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors.",6,7,disgust
I think you are talking nonsense.,6,7,disgust
"Oh.  So is everyone, in the long run.",6,6,sadness
"Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.",5,0,surprise
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,6,6,sadness
"Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.",6,6,sadness
"Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",2,7,disgust
"Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.",6,3,anger
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,5,4,fear
Which particular one?,5,6,sadness
The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed.,6,7,disgust
"Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.",6,6,sadness
[GARBAGE],6,6,sadness
It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.,6,4,fear
I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that.,6,0,surprise
How long did that row last?,5,6,sadness
It went on intermittently for days.,6,6,sadness
But the worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,7,disgust
"Oh And it burnt my comb, too, and all of those towels in the bathroom.",6,7,disgust
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",5,7,disgust
[LAUGHTER] That was the first time you hit me.,6,5,neutral
I did not hit you very hard.,6,6,sadness
"The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,7,disgust
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],6,6,sadness
[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.,6,6,sadness
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,6,1,joy
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,6,6,sadness
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,6,5,neutral
We were very much younger then.,6,6,sadness
And very much sillier.,6,1,joy
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,6,7,disgust
"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",5,6,sadness
"It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too.",6,7,disgust
"It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty.",6,6,sadness
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,6,3,anger
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,6,sadness
"Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.",5,6,sadness
"Well, what of it?",5,3,anger
What of it?,5,5,neutral
It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,6,1,joy
What about me?,5,4,fear
"If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",6,4,fear
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",6,1,joy
Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.,2,0,surprise
So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?,5,0,surprise
No.  Thank you.,6,1,joy
"I'll have a little, I think.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.",6,5,neutral
"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.",6,6,sadness
I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.,6,7,disgust
"You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.",6,6,sadness
It's become a habit with you.,6,6,sadness
Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.,6,6,sadness
Don't be stupid.,6,3,anger
"Really, Amanda.",6,5,neutral
Nothing.,6,6,sadness
"you going out somewhere, dear?",5,5,neutral
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,6,6,sadness
That reply has broken my heart.,6,0,surprise
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,6,6,sadness
"Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.",6,6,sadness
No it isn't.,6,6,sadness
You shut up.,6,3,anger
"Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",3,7,disgust
It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you.,6,5,neutral
"Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.",6,3,anger
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",6,3,anger
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.,6,3,anger
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,5,3,anger
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,5,6,sadness
"Yes I did, quite a lot.",6,6,sadness
"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.",5,6,sadness
Mind your own business.,6,6,sadness
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",6,3,anger
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,6,6,sadness
You've always had a weak head.,6,6,sadness
I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,6,6,sadness
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,7,disgust
"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",5,6,sadness
Oh shut up.,6,3,anger
Shut up.,6,3,anger
"Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",6,5,neutral
[LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will.,6,6,sadness
"Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.",6,3,anger
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,6,6,sadness
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,6,6,sadness
They are away in Tunis.,6,6,sadness
This is no time of year for Tunis.,6,6,sadness
"Turn it on again, please.",6,6,sadness
I will do no such thing.,6,3,anger
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,6,3,anger
"Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.",3,3,anger
"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",6,3,anger
Turn it off.,6,6,sadness
"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",5,4,fear
"Amanda, listen, listen.",6,6,sadness
Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.,6,1,joy
"Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",5,3,anger
"You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",6,7,disgust
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,5,6,sadness
You're not going like this.,6,7,disgust
Oh.  Yes I am.,6,5,neutral
You're not.,6,6,sadness

I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,6,0,surprise
She is not Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
"From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",6,6,sadness

Like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,6,7,disgust
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",6,6,sadness
What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?,5,5,neutral
That's my point too.,6,6,sadness
Then let's go.,6,6,sadness
"No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.",6,6,sadness
Don't you want to see it?,5,3,anger
"I just don't, it's stupid.",6,3,anger
It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.,6,7,disgust
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,6,6,sadness
"Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",5,6,sadness
Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy.,6,6,sadness
"I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.",1,5,neutral
"Yeah, they do.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, Augie.",6,6,sadness
"Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.",6,6,sadness
"It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.",6,5,neutral
I'm not.,6,6,sadness
All right.,6,6,sadness
"I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...",6,5,neutral
And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.,1,5,neutral
"Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",6,7,disgust
We just weren't in a good spot though.,6,6,sadness
We didn't see them the year before either.,6,6,sadness
We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.,6,6,sadness
"Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...",5,4,fear
"Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...",6,6,sadness
"They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...",6,5,neutral
They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...,6,6,sadness
Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...,6,6,sadness
"And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...",6,6,sadness
It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.,6,6,sadness
"It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.",6,7,disgust
They're out there swimming right now...,6,6,sadness

"Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.",6,3,anger
"Well, so?  What do you think?",5,5,neutral
It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,7,disgust
It's a PR.,6,6,sadness
Somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach.,6,5,neutral
"It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people.",5,6,sadness
They're all told the same thing.,6,6,sadness
"Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.",1,6,sadness
"Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.",6,6,sadness
Their life will start then.,6,6,sadness
Are we talking about the same thing?,5,5,neutral
I'm sorry it still just fish to me.,6,0,surprise
Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?,5,6,sadness
"Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",5,3,anger
"Okay, well then what's bugging you?",5,3,anger
"I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",6,6,sadness
"Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.",6,6,sadness
"Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.",6,0,surprise
And then we go home and they go home.,6,6,sadness
"Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?",5,5,neutral
We missed them twice.,6,0,surprise
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.,6,6,sadness
"Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.",6,6,sadness
No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.,6,6,sadness
"I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.",6,1,joy
"Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards",6,6,sadness
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,6,3,anger
and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.,6,7,disgust
Of course not.,6,6,sadness
"I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.",6,6,sadness
"Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.",6,7,disgust
"you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.",6,6,sadness
"Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go.""",6,6,sadness
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--,6,6,sadness
Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.,5,6,sadness
We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.,6,5,neutral
"While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them.",6,7,disgust
"And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,1,joy
"Wait a minute, I've got it.",6,6,sadness
"Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.",6,4,fear
"It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?",5,6,sadness
"You want this to be like the other times, right?",5,6,sadness
"Oh right sure, of course.",6,6,sadness
Do you want to dance?,5,6,sadness
You want me to go get some champagne?,5,3,anger
Do you want to take off our shoes?,5,6,sadness
What? Huh?,5,5,neutral
You want to get married again?,5,5,neutral
What?  What?  You want to divorce?,5,5,neutral
"A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?",5,5,neutral
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,6,6,sadness
"Well, welcome to the human race.",6,6,sadness
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.,5,5,neutral
"You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think ""Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska.""",6,5,neutral
"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",6,6,sadness
No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.,5,6,sadness
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,5,neutral
"Yeah, it is.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.",6,6,sadness
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,6,6,sadness
I know me neither.,6,6,sadness
This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,5,5,neutral
"I know that Augie, I really do.",6,1,joy
"I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",6,0,surprise
Maybe if you were with somebody else too?,5,6,sadness
"No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.",1,0,surprise
Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.,5,5,neutral
"Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?",5,3,anger
"You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",1,6,sadness
"Actually, you know what?  Now you mentioned that--no I don't.",5,5,neutral
So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.,6,6,sadness
"I don't know, just seemed like such a good spot to me.",6,6,sadness
We do have really good view of the moon from here though.,6,6,sadness
Oh I saw that.  Pretty isn't it. Big ol' white moon.,6,5,neutral
Look what we got here.,6,5,neutral
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",6,6,sadness

I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.,6,6,sadness
Shh...,6,7,disgust

Do you think it's them?,5,5,neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up.,6,6,sadness
Must be them then.,6,6,sadness

Of course how long did that row last?,5,6,sadness
But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,6,7,disgust
Cannes...mmhmm...,6,6,sadness
Oh it burnt my comb too and all those towels in the bathroom.,6,0,surprise

"However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,6,sadness
Oh you knew there was nothing in that.,6,5,neutral
"[LAUGHTER] Utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,7,disgust

Presents? It was a trivial little broach.,5,7,disgust
It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,6,7,disgust
Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.,6,6,sadness

I did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,6,sadness
"Well, you let him kiss you.  You said you did.",6,6,sadness
"It gave him a lot, a great deal of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.",6,1,joy
And what about me?,5,6,sadness
If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd never known a thing about it.,6,4,fear
That's a nice point of view I must say.,6,1,joy

"No, thank you.",6,6,sadness
I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.,6,5,neutral
"Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.",6,6,sadness
I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.,6,7,disgust
You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.,6,6,sadness
"I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you.",6,6,sadness
"Hmm.  Well, you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment, okay?",5,6,sadness
Do be quiet.,6,6,sadness

I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, mind you own business.",6,6,sadness
"I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",5,1,joy
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.",6,3,anger
I am not in the least bit drunk.,6,7,disgust
You always had a weak head.,6,6,sadness
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,6,6,sadness
"On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,7,disgust
"Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.",5,6,sadness

"You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.",6,7,disgust
This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,5,6,sadness

No you're not.,6,6,sadness
Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.,6,3,anger

Right.  It's the D.M.V..,6,6,sadness
"I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?",5,6,sadness
"Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.",6,3,anger

"All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.",2,0,surprise
"So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.",6,6,sadness

"Yeah, hello.",6,6,sadness
Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.,6,0,surprise
"All right, sir.",6,6,sadness
"I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because--",6,0,surprise
I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.,6,6,sadness
"Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?",5,4,fear
"Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-",6,6,sadness
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.",6,6,sadness
"I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,",6,6,sadness

You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.,5,6,sadness
Is that all right?,5,6,sadness
"I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.",6,6,sadness
All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-,6,6,sadness
[BREATHING] that's good.,6,1,joy
"um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.",6,6,sadness
"All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.",6,1,joy
Absolutely. we we,6,6,sadness
"Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.",6,6,sadness
"So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.",6,6,sadness
Okay. So--,6,6,sadness
"Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a",6,6,sadness
"--you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um",6,1,joy
Great.  How many seats?,5,5,neutral
"Well, it's gonna be four of them.",6,6,sadness
Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.,6,1,joy
All right.  And can they like all get together?,5,6,sadness
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?",5,6,sadness
"Um- You know, window is nice. I guess",6,6,sadness
"Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?",5,6,sadness
"All right, Sure.  A yeah, that- that'd be good.",6,1,joy
Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?,5,1,joy
"Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--",6,6,sadness
All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.,6,6,sadness
"So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.",6,6,sadness
"And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.",6,6,sadness
Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.,6,6,sadness
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.,6,6,sadness
"Okay.  Wow.  Sounds good then, I guess.  Thank you very much. It's a lot better than talking to a machine.",6,1,joy
Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.,6,6,sadness
All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.,6,6,sadness
Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.,6,1,joy
What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,5,6,sadness
"How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",5,5,neutral
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,6,5,neutral
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,5,5,neutral
"I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",6,5,neutral
No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.,6,0,surprise
He cried hard?,5,5,neutral
I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,6,4,fear
What was he doing out here at that hour?,5,5,neutral
He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,6,4,fear
He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,5,6,sadness
"I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",3,4,fear
"Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",6,6,sadness
What you mean dishonest?,5,3,anger
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,5,5,neutral
What do you want to do argue with him?,5,3,anger
"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore?",5,6,sadness
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?,5,4,fear
Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?,5,5,neutral
"For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",6,5,neutral
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?",5,6,sadness
"Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry.",6,4,fear
All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,5,6,sadness
"I've got an idea, but what's the story?",5,6,sadness
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,6,1,joy
You know it's not only my business.,6,6,sadness
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,5,6,sadness
So it's all right then?,5,6,sadness
I'll go ahead with it?,5,6,sadness
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to--",6,6,sadness
"Well, then it isn't just my business--",6,6,sadness
I'm just saying that--,6,6,sadness
"Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",5,3,anger
I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
"From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.",6,6,sadness
"And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",5,6,sadness
"I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.",6,3,anger
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,6,6,sadness
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?,5,5,neutral
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.",5,6,sadness
"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",5,6,sadness
"Trouble is, you don't see enough women.",6,7,disgust
You never did.,6,6,sadness
"So what, I'm not fast with women.",6,6,sadness
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,6,5,neutral
"Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.",6,6,sadness
"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her.",6,0,surprise
"These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",5,6,sadness
"I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.",6,7,disgust
"I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.",5,4,fear
"All right.  All right, then, Mom.",6,6,sadness
I just--give it some more thought.,6,6,sadness
I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,1,6,sadness
"But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",6,0,surprise
I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.,6,6,sadness
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,6,1,joy
What about the business?  What the hell is this?,5,5,neutral
Must you be inspired?,5,6,sadness
"Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",6,3,anger
"I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it?",5,0,surprise
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",5,3,anger
"All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you.",5,6,sadness
"I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.",6,6,sadness
"All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?",5,3,anger
I am thinkin' that way.,6,6,sadness
She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?,5,5,neutral
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",6,6,sadness
What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?,5,5,neutral
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,6,3,anger
She's not-,6,6,sadness
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,5,5,neutral
-he's not gonna marry her.,6,0,surprise
It's got that all about it.,6,6,sadness
"Well, so what?",5,3,anger
"What's going on here, Joe?",5,5,neutral
"Now, listen Kate.",6,6,sadness
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",6,6,sadness
"Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.",5,5,neutral
How do you know why she's waited?,5,5,neutral
"She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,7,disgust
"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",5,1,joy
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",5,3,anger
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?",5,3,anger
I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.,6,6,sadness
But Kate--,6,6,sadness
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",6,3,anger
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,5,5,neutral
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.",6,0,surprise
"Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.",6,7,disgust
All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.,6,6,sadness
"You, above all, have to believe.",6,6,sadness
What?- Why- Why me above all?,5,5,neutral
Just--just don't stop believing.,6,3,anger
What does that mean?  Me above all?,5,5,neutral
Look at you.  Look at you shaking.,6,4,fear
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,5,5,neutral
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,2,6,sadness
"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",5,6,sadness
It's all right.  It's a good thing.,6,1,joy
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",2,1,joy
"No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.",6,0,surprise
"Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",6,6,sadness
"You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",6,6,sadness
"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",6,7,disgust
"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.",6,6,sadness
"Well,",6,6,sadness
"from her point of view, why else would I come?",5,3,anger
"Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",5,5,neutral
I--I guess this is why I came.,6,6,sadness
"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",2,1,joy
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,6,6,sadness
I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,6,0,surprise
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",5,0,surprise
"Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",6,6,sadness
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,5,5,neutral
You started to write me and--,6,3,anger
"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",5,3,anger
"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.",5,6,sadness
"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",6,6,sadness
"oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",6,5,neutral
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,5,5,neutral
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",1,1,joy
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",5,5,neutral
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,6,0,surprise
"No.  What is it, your mother?",5,5,neutral
No.  Nothing like that.,6,6,sadness
"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",5,7,disgust
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",6,6,sadness
You've gotta tell me.,6,6,sadness
I don't know how to start.,6,4,fear
It wouldn't work this way.,6,6,sadness
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",5,5,neutral
"Well, I lost them.",6,0,surprise
Just about all.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, gee.",6,7,disgust
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,6,6,sadness
"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",6,6,sadness
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",6,3,anger
"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",3,7,disgust
"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",5,6,sadness
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,6,5,neutral
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",6,0,surprise
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",2,6,sadness
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,6,6,sadness
You still feel that way?,5,5,neutral
I want you now Annie.,6,6,sadness
"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.",5,6,sadness
"I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",6,3,anger
"I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.",6,1,joy
What'll I do with a fortune?,5,3,anger
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.,5,5,neutral
"This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.",5,5,neutral
"I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.",4,4,fear
How you doing?,5,5,neutral
Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.,5,5,neutral
"Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",5,4,fear
"How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",5,5,neutral
"You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",5,5,neutral
Who's is it?,5,5,neutral
It's ours.  It's mine too.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, well sure.",6,6,sadness
"You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?",5,5,neutral
"Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",6,6,sadness
How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,5,6,sadness
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",5,5,neutral
"You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.",5,5,neutral
"This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.",5,5,neutral
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,6,5,neutral
You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,5,5,neutral
"It's after eleven, let's just go home.",6,6,sadness
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.,5,5,neutral
There is no point in coming down here.,6,6,sadness
"So, let's go.",6,6,sadness
No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?,5,3,anger
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.",6,6,sadness
"Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",6,6,sadness
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",5,6,sadness
"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",6,7,disgust
this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,6,1,joy
"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",5,5,neutral
"Ah, Augie.",6,6,sadness
Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,6,6,sadness
There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,6,5,neutral
"I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",6,5,neutral
"And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.",1,6,sadness
"Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.",6,7,disgust
We weren't in a good spot.,6,0,surprise
We didn't see them the first time either.,6,5,neutral
"We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.",6,6,sadness
There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?,5,6,sadness
"Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.",5,5,neutral
"Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.",6,7,disgust
"They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-",6,5,neutral
"all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.",6,6,sadness
It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.,6,6,sadness
"They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",6,6,sadness
"Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.",6,5,neutral
"Well, so what do you think?",5,6,sadness
What I was saying.,6,6,sadness
It's ridiculous.,6,7,disgust
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.,6,5,neutral
"Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.",6,7,disgust
"Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.",1,1,joy
"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",6,6,sadness
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",5,6,sadness
"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",6,3,anger
"Well, what's bugging you?",5,3,anger
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,6,6,sadness
"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",6,4,fear
"For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",6,7,disgust
"We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?",5,5,neutral
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,6,6,sadness
Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,6,6,sadness
"Well, we'll see them this year.",6,6,sadness
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.",6,0,surprise
"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",6,6,sadness
"No, of course not.",6,6,sadness
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,6,6,sadness
It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.,6,7,disgust
"For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.",6,6,sadness
"All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.",6,7,disgust
"I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.",6,6,sadness
"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""",6,1,joy
"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",6,6,sadness
"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",5,6,sadness
"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",6,5,neutral
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",6,7,disgust
"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",1,1,joy
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,6,6,sadness
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",6,7,disgust
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",5,6,sadness
"Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",5,6,sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,6,6,sadness
"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",5,1,joy
Take off our shoes?,5,5,neutral
No. No.,6,6,sadness
"Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?",5,5,neutral
You wanna get married again?,5,5,neutral
What?  What?  You want a divorce?,5,5,neutral
"A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?",5,5,neutral
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",5,6,sadness
"No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?",5,5,neutral
"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",6,1,joy
"'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",5,6,sadness
This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,5,neutral
"Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,6,sadness
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,6,6,sadness
"I know, me neither.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",5,6,sadness
"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",6,6,sadness
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",6,5,neutral
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,6,6,sadness
"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",1,0,surprise
"Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",6,7,disgust
"Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?",5,3,anger
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,1,6,sadness
"Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",6,6,sadness
"Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",6,5,neutral
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.",5,5,neutral
"Well, look what we have here.",6,7,disgust
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",6,6,sadness
You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?,5,5,neutral
No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.,6,6,sadness
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,6,4,fear
"Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,6,sadness
"Must be them, then.",6,6,sadness
What're we gonna do?,5,3,anger
"We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens.",5,6,sadness
It was bound to come sooner or later.,6,6,sadness
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,5,5,neutral
"Ah, it send shivers up my spine.",6,4,fear
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,5,5,neutral
Behave exquisitely.,6,6,sadness
With the most perfect poise?,5,6,sadness
"Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.",6,6,sadness
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?,5,4,fear
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,1,4,fear
"Oh, darling, don't say that.",6,6,sadness
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,6,7,disgust
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",5,6,sadness
"Yes, meaning just that.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,5,neutral
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,6,0,surprise
"You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.",2,3,anger
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.,6,1,joy
Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,2,6,sadness
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",6,1,joy
"Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.",6,1,joy
"Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.",2,6,sadness
Who knows.,6,6,sadness
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",5,6,sadness
"No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.",6,0,surprise
"Oh, dear, shall we like that?",5,6,sadness
Depends on how well we've played.,6,6,sadness
"Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?",5,6,sadness
Yes.  Yes. With all his might.,6,6,sadness
"That's serious enough, isn't it?",5,3,anger
"No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",6,6,sadness
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",6,3,anger
So is everyone else in the long run.,6,6,sadness
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.",1,1,joy
"Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",6,7,disgust
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",6,6,sadness
"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.",2,3,anger
"Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",2,3,anger
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,5,4,fear
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,6,6,sadness
Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,6,6,sadness
"Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it.",6,7,disgust
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",6,0,surprise
It went in intermittently for days.,6,6,sadness
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,7,disgust
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,6,7,disgust
That was the first time you ever hit me.,6,5,neutral
I didn't hit you very hard.,6,6,sadness
"The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.",6,7,disgust
"Oh, I'll never forget his face.",6,6,sadness
It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.,6,7,disgust
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,6,sadness
"Honey, you knew there was nothing in that.",6,5,neutral
Presents?  Just a trivial little broach.,5,6,sadness
"Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,7,disgust
"No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.",6,6,sadness
"No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",6,6,sadness
"You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he?",5,6,sadness
"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",6,6,sadness
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,6,6,sadness
It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it.,1,1,joy
"Well, what about me?",5,6,sadness
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",6,6,sadness
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",6,1,joy
"Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?",5,0,surprise
"No, thanks.",6,6,sadness
I think I'll have some.,6,6,sadness
Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.,6,5,neutral
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,6,6,sadness
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,7,disgust
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,6,6,sadness
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",6,6,sadness
"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",6,6,sadness
Don't be so stupid.,6,3,anger
Going out somewhere dear?,5,5,neutral
"No, just making myself fascinating for you.",6,6,sadness
"A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",5,6,sadness
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",6,6,sadness
"No, it isn't.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, be quiet.",6,6,sadness
"Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.",3,0,surprise
Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,6,5,neutral
"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",6,3,anger
Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,6,3,anger
They snap.,6,3,anger
"I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.",5,3,anger
"Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",6,5,neutral
"Hmm, I imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all.  Very enjoyable and never had much anyhow.",1,1,joy
You're quite insufferable,6,3,anger
I expect it's because you're drunk.,6,6,sadness
I'm not in the least drunk.,6,7,disgust
"As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",6,6,sadness
"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,7,disgust
"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?",5,5,neutral
"We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.",5,6,sadness
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",2,5,neutral
All right.  I will.,6,6,sadness
"You better turn that off, I think.",6,6,sadness
Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,6,3,anger
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,6,6,sadness
There are people downstairs I suppose?,5,5,neutral
They're away in Tunis.,6,6,sadness
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,6,6,sadness
I'll do no such thing.,6,3,anger
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",6,6,sadness
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,3,3,anger
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,6,3,anger
Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.,6,3,anger
"Amanda, listen. listen",6,6,sadness
"Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",5,4,fear
"Very amusing, indeed.",6,1,joy
"I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",5,3,anger
"You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.",6,7,disgust
This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.,5,6,sadness
"Oh Yes, I am.",6,6,sadness
I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,6,3,anger
Shut up. Shut up.,6,3,anger
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,6,3,anger
I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,6,7,disgust
Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,6,3,anger
You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,6,7,disgust
All right. Finally. Here you go.,6,6,sadness
"Hi, How can I help you?",5,4,fear
"Yea. I just want to get this done,",6,6,sadness
"Sure, um",6,6,sadness

do you have two forms of ID with you?,5,6,sadness
"Um, no, I got my driver's license though.",6,6,sadness
"I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.",6,0,surprise
"Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -",6,0,surprise
Well,6,6,sadness
well is the dri-driver's license going to work?,5,6,sadness
I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.,6,6,sadness
"Okay, so what are you saying? What-",5,3,anger
"Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.",6,6,sadness
"What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after",5,5,neutral
"Well, I'm sorry sir but",6,0,surprise
three hours and,6,6,sadness
you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.,6,6,sadness
Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?,5,5,neutral
"Well, it's actually-",6,6,sadness
"It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry.",6,0,surprise
"It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my",5,6,sadness
"Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible.",6,0,surprise
"I filled out the application right, didn't I?",5,6,sadness
"Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.",6,6,sadness
Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-,6,6,sadness
"I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again.",6,0,surprise
I've been waiting for three hours.,6,6,sadness
"It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you.",6,0,surprise
This is ridiculous. Come on,6,3,anger
"I'm sorry, sir.",6,0,surprise
"I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-",6,6,sadness
there is nothing I can do.,6,0,surprise
"But my driver's license - I had to have my birth certificate to get my driver's license in the first place right, I mean this - here is my driver's license so",6,6,sadness
"I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry.",6,0,surprise
That doesn't make any sense. Why?,5,7,disgust
"I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do.",6,0,surprise
You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application,6,6,sadness
"Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said.",6,6,sadness
If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.,6,6,sadness
"What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.",6,5,neutral
"Well, maybe you should",6,6,sadness
I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.,6,6,sadness
Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.,6,6,sadness
"I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.",6,0,surprise
"God, oh my-",6,5,neutral
This is ridiculous.,6,7,disgust

I don't want to be a single mom.,6,0,surprise
"You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and",6,6,sadness

I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.,6,6,sadness
"Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.",6,6,sadness
"I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get",6,6,sadness
"No, it doesn't work that way",6,6,sadness
"but, I mean, I'm going to do whatever I can and get back here as fast as I can.",6,6,sadness
It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.,6,7,disgust
"I know, but it's not our decision, I guess, you know, I mean",6,6,sadness
there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country,6,6,sadness
"and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back",6,6,sadness
"Will you write me letters, paper ones?",5,6,sadness
"Yeah, of course. I don't know if we'll have computers or anything like that you know, so probably my only option then.",6,6,sadness
"Yeah, I'll write you every day 'cause you're the only thing that's going to be on my mind.",6,6,sadness
"Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.",6,6,sadness

"I know, so",6,6,sadness
I got to freak her out.,6,3,anger
"No, yes -- so",6,6,sadness
She must have flipped out.,6,6,sadness
"Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.",6,6,sadness
Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER],6,7,disgust
"No, but it was good.",6,1,joy
Did you bring her up on stage too?,5,5,neutral

"Well, we're thinking uh - we're thinking winter time, you know, we're going to do it in the winter and then maybe, you know, maybe",6,6,sadness
"I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia, Southern Hemisphere, [GARBAGE] so we'll decide with that.",6,6,sadness
"Ooh, that would be fun.",6,1,joy
"Do you think you'll get a house or something, like you guys are looking to buy some place or",6,6,sadness
"Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first",6,6,sadness
Yeah. [LAUGHTER],6,6,sadness

"Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.",6,5,neutral
"Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]",6,1,joy
"Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.",6,6,sadness
Did you have a good ring? You better have had a good ring.,5,0,surprise

Good. The ring makes all the difference.,6,6,sadness

"I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",6,6,sadness
"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",6,6,sadness
"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",6,6,sadness
"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",5,6,sadness
"I don't know, I mean why - why",6,5,neutral
"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",6,7,disgust
"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",6,6,sadness
"Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like",6,6,sadness
"I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",6,3,anger
"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",6,6,sadness
"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",6,3,anger
You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,6,6,sadness
"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",6,4,fear
"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and",6,0,surprise
I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,6,6,sadness
I'm sorry.,6,0,surprise
"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",6,6,sadness
"maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",6,6,sadness
"Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",6,6,sadness
Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,6,6,sadness
"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",6,6,sadness
"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",6,6,sadness
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,6,6,sadness
"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",6,0,surprise
"It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.",6,7,disgust
this doesn't happen to a normal person.,6,7,disgust
"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",6,6,sadness
"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",6,6,sadness
"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",6,6,sadness
What am I going to do on a break?,5,6,sadness
"Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.",1,3,anger
Right. Thanks for talking to me.,6,1,joy

"For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",5,5,neutral
"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",6,6,sadness
Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,6,5,neutral
What? What? How does that happen?,5,5,neutral
"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",6,4,fear
I really - I really need that bag.,6,5,neutral
"I- I- I understand, but um.",6,4,fear

"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",6,6,sadness
"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",6,6,sadness
can they check there?,5,6,sadness
"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",6,3,anger
on another-,6,6,sadness
"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",6,6,sadness
So we'll- what we'll do,6,6,sadness
"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",6,6,sadness

Theft?,5,5,neutral
"Um, so.",6,6,sadness
"Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",5,3,anger
"We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know",6,6,sadness

"all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage",6,6,sadness
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-,6,6,sadness
You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage],5,7,disgust
"I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.",6,6,sadness
Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.,5,6,sadness
"Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",6,6,sadness
"Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on",6,6,sadness
"that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.",6,6,sadness
The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,6,0,surprise
The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,5,5,neutral
Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,6,6,sadness
"we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-",6,6,sadness
I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do,5,3,anger
because this is ridiculous?,5,3,anger
I'm sorry. I don't- I-,6,0,surprise
I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-,6,0,surprise

"What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night.",5,6,sadness
He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?,5,6,sadness
"I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.",3,4,fear
Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,6,6,sadness
You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,5,7,disgust
"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",6,6,sadness
"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",5,4,fear

See it isn't just my business-,6,6,sadness

I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,6,6,sadness
"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",5,6,sadness
"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",6,3,anger
Have you asked Annie yet?,5,6,sadness
How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,5,6,sadness
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",5,6,sadness
"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",6,0,surprise
So what I'm not fast with women.,6,6,sadness

"Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?",5,3,anger
All right. All right. Mom.,6,6,sadness
"I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.",1,6,sadness
"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",6,0,surprise
"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",6,6,sadness

"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",6,0,surprise
What about the business? What is this?,5,5,neutral
"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",6,7,disgust
I want a family; I want kids; I want something I can give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?,5,6,sadness
"All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you.",6,6,sadness
I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.,6,6,sadness
Just don't go thinking that way.,6,3,anger
"Well, I am thinking that way.",6,6,sadness
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",6,7,disgust
"Yea, I can see that.",6,6,sadness
She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,6,5,neutral
"What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?",5,5,neutral
"Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",6,3,anger
What's going on here Joe?,5,5,neutral
"All right. Now, listen kid-",6,3,anger
-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,6,6,sadness
"Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.",5,5,neutral
How do you know why she has waited?,5,5,neutral
"She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,7,disgust
"Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?",5,1,joy
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",6,3,anger
What do you want me to do about it?,5,3,anger
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",6,3,anger
But Kate,6,5,neutral
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but",6,3,anger
"why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces, just look at it, look.",6,5,neutral
I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.,6,4,fear
"Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",6,6,sadness
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,6,6,sadness
Just you above all need to believe.,6,6,sadness
"Wait, why my above all?",5,5,neutral
Don't stop believing.,6,3,anger
"What does that mean, me above all?",5,5,neutral
Look at you -- look at you shaking.,6,4,fear
"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",5,3,anger
"No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.",6,0,surprise
"For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",6,7,disgust
"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.",6,6,sadness
How'd you know?,5,5,neutral
"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",5,6,sadness
I guess this is why I came.,6,6,sadness
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",2,1,joy
"You feel wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",5,0,surprise
"Well, you started to write me",6,6,sadness
"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",5,5,neutral
"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know?",5,6,sadness
"God, I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",6,5,neutral
"I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean, all I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.",5,5,neutral
"No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother?",5,5,neutral
"Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",5,7,disgust
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company?",5,5,neutral
gee.,6,6,sadness
"For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.",6,6,sadness
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",6,3,anger
"I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?",5,7,disgust
"To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",6,6,sadness
"Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",6,5,neutral
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",6,0,surprise
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",2,6,sadness
Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,6,6,sadness
"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",5,6,sadness
"I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",6,3,anger
I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you.,6,1,joy
What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.,5,5,neutral
"God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.",5,5,neutral
"I would have wanted to go a little further up the coast, get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid we'd miss it.",4,4,fear
"Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.",5,5,neutral
"Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",5,6,sadness
How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?,5,5,neutral
"You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?",5,5,neutral
It's ours; it's mine too.,6,6,sadness
"Oh well, sure, yes.",6,6,sadness
But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?,5,5,neutral
"No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight, es su flashlight, naturally.",6,6,sadness
"I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year, do you remember?",5,5,neutral
Yea.,6,7,disgust
"You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?",5,3,anger
"Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,",6,5,neutral
"oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.",6,5,neutral
You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,5,6,sadness
What you want my jacket?,5,6,sadness
It's after eleven. Let's just go home.,6,6,sadness
"Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?",5,3,anger
So let's go.,6,6,sadness
No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,5,3,anger
"I don't, it's just stupid.",6,3,anger
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.",6,6,sadness
"Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.",6,6,sadness
"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.",5,6,sadness
"Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.",6,6,sadness
"This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.",6,6,sadness
What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,5,5,neutral
Yes they do.,6,6,sadness
Augie,6,6,sadness
"Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs",6,6,sadness
"you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.",6,5,neutral
I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.,6,5,neutral
"And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.",1,5,neutral
"Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",6,7,disgust
We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,6,6,sadness
"There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?",5,7,disgust
"This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.",5,6,sadness
"Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,",6,6,sadness
"they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.",6,5,neutral
"Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.",6,6,sadness
"It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,",6,6,sadness
"they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",6,6,sadness
Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.,6,3,anger
Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,6,sadness
It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,6,6,sadness
"Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.",6,6,sadness
"Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.",1,6,sadness
I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,6,0,surprise
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",5,6,sadness
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,6,3,anger
"There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.",6,6,sadness
For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.,6,6,sadness
"We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?",5,5,neutral
We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,6,6,sadness
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",6,6,sadness
"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",6,7,disgust
I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,6,1,joy
I thought you wanted to see them.,6,6,sadness
No of course not.,6,6,sadness
"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",6,6,sadness
"It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.",6,6,sadness
For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,6,6,sadness
All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.,6,7,disgust
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",6,6,sadness
"""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",6,1,joy
"okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-",6,6,sadness
Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,5,6,sadness
"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",6,7,disgust
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,6,6,sadness
"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",1,1,joy
Wait a minute I've got it,6,5,neutral
"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",5,6,sadness
"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",5,6,sadness
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,6,6,sadness
"Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",5,7,disgust
You want to go get some champagne?,5,5,neutral
"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",5,5,neutral
Get married again?,5,5,neutral
What? What? You want a divorce?,5,5,neutral
"A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?",5,5,neutral
I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,6,6,sadness
"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",5,6,sadness
"You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?",5,5,neutral
"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",6,1,joy
"'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",5,6,sadness
"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",5,5,neutral
"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",6,6,sadness
"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",6,6,sadness
"No, I know. Me neither.",6,6,sadness
I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,5,6,sadness
I know that Augie. Really I do.,6,5,neutral
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",6,5,neutral
"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",1,0,surprise
"For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",6,3,anger
Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,5,3,anger
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",1,6,sadness
"Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",6,3,anger
"Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",6,6,sadness
I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,6,5,neutral
"Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.",5,5,neutral
What have we got here?,5,5,neutral
"Well, I guess we don't need glasses.",6,6,sadness
You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?,5,3,anger
No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all.,6,6,sadness
"Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.",6,6,sadness
"Well, nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,6,sadness
What are we going to do?,5,5,neutral
"We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",5,6,sadness
It's bound to come sooner or later.,6,6,sadness
Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.,5,5,neutral
Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.,6,4,fear
With the most perfect poise.,6,6,sadness
"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",6,6,sadness
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",5,4,fear
Oh darling don't say that.,6,6,sadness
It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke.,6,7,disgust
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?,5,6,sadness
Yes. Meaning just that.,6,6,sadness
What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?,5,5,neutral
Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,6,3,anger
"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",2,3,anger
"All those futile moralists, who try to make life unbearable, laugh at them, be flippant. Laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths",6,6,sadness
flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.,2,6,sadness
"Well, if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.",6,1,joy
"Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.",6,1,joy
"No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",6,0,surprise
Depends on how well we play it.,6,6,sadness
"Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",5,6,sadness
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",6,6,sadness
"No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",6,7,disgust
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.",1,1,joy
Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,6,7,disgust
"Elliot, worms don't pop.",6,6,sadness
"I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome, and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word, as long as you love me best.",2,3,anger
"Thank you dear, the same applies you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",2,3,anger
"The one when you bought that little, painted, wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.",6,6,sadness
"Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.",6,6,sadness
"Horrible thing, I hated it.",6,7,disgust
I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,6,7,disgust
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,7,disgust
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,6,7,disgust
I'll never forget his face.,6,6,sadness
"Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.",6,7,disgust
As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,6,6,sadness
You knew there was nothing in that.,6,5,neutral
"Presents, just a trivial little broach.",6,6,sadness
"Yes, I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,7,disgust
No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,6,6,sadness
"No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",6,3,anger
"You must admit he was in love with you, wasn't he?",5,6,sadness
You let him kiss you; you said you did.,6,6,sadness
"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",6,1,joy
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.",6,6,sadness
I'm bored of this conversation.,6,0,surprise
"Yes, me too, bored stiff. You want some Brandy?",5,6,sadness
No thanks.,6,7,disgust
I have a little I think.,6,6,sadness
I don't see why you want any you've already had two glasses.,6,5,neutral
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",6,6,sadness
It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,7,disgust
You needn't be so grand just because don't happen want any yourself right now.,6,6,sadness
No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,6,6,sadness
"Going out somewhere, dear?",5,6,sadness
It's a woman's job to allure the man,6,6,sadness
"watch me a minute, will you?",5,6,sadness
"Oh, no it isn't.",6,6,sadness
Be quiet.,6,6,sadness
It's a pity you didn't have any more Brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3,7,disgust
It doesn't seem to work such wonders with you.,6,6,sadness
Adders don't snap they sting.,6,3,anger
Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,6,3,anger
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,5,3,anger
"Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",5,6,sadness
I imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then.,6,6,sadness
What riotous time you must have had.,6,3,anger
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.",1,1,joy
You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.,6,3,anger
I am not in the least drunk.,6,7,disgust
"I imagine, as I may have already mentioned, I've had three minute liquor glasses of Brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",6,6,sadness
On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy.,6,7,disgust
"Oh very interesting. How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine?",5,5,neutral
Oh be quiet.,6,0,surprise
"We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",5,3,anger
"Not very funny my dear, you better have some more Brandy.",2,5,neutral
All right. I will.,6,6,sadness
Better turn that off I think.,6,6,sadness
There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio.,6,6,sadness
Turn it off it's driving me mad.,3,3,anger
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,6,3,anger
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,6,3,anger
"Amanda, listen. Listen.",6,6,sadness
"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",0,4,fear
Very amusing indeed.,6,1,joy
"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",5,3,anger
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",6,7,disgust
"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",5,6,sadness
Oh yes I am.,6,6,sadness
"Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",6,3,anger
I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,6,3,anger
You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,6,3,anger
"God, finally I got to the line, the front of the line. I've been waiting there for like half an hour.",6,5,neutral
[BREATHING] It's so hot in here. Hoo.,6,7,disgust
"Oh, um-",6,6,sadness
What's wrong?,5,3,anger
"You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.",6,6,sadness
"No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line.",6,7,disgust
Who?,5,5,neutral
I don't know. Some lady. Sonya or something.,6,6,sadness
She- she probably doesn't even work here.,6,6,sadness
"Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there..",5,7,disgust
All right  Uh-,6,6,sadness
and she told me to come over here and she said to fill out everything on the application and I did that.,6,6,sadness
It's not right.,6,7,disgust
"Look, I-- No, no, no, I--you don't understand. I have to go back to work.",6,3,anger
You just take--all right.,6,6,sadness
"Well, you didn't fill this paper at work out right and it's going to take another fifteen minutes to do it and look at how long the line we got here so just-",6,6,sadness
I am not-,6,6,sadness
"okay, just go back and fill it out real quick and I'm sorry, you have to get back in line and wait. I can't let you cut.",6,6,sadness
But you don't understand. I cannot get back in line because I have to go back to work. I will get fired if I don't leave here.,6,3,anger
"Well, maybe you should have got here earlier than so you had a lot of time to do this.",6,6,sadness
But I was at work and the lady told me to come and work it and to stand in the line.,6,7,disgust
I don't know who this lady is.,6,5,neutral

"No no, we're not taking anything from you sir.  This is- This is unbeknownst to us.  The problem had just happened.",6,4,fear
The satellite-is down in your area.,6,5,neutral
"Okay, so you think you're going to-  -get me back some minutes, and that's going to make up for three days of business that I lost?  Okay, great.",5,6,sadness
"No, three days, sir.  It's not three days. It's- It's only been about a day now. Let's not exaggerate.",6,6,sadness
"No, it's been--three days.",6,6,sadness
"Fine, it's been a day.  Okay?",5,6,sadness
Three days?,5,5,neutral
A day?,5,5,neutral
A day's worth of business.  You know how much I make in a day?,5,6,sadness
"I don't know, sir.",6,7,disgust
About three million dollars.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-",6,0,surprise
"So, you're going to give me back ten dollars worth of minutes--",6,6,sadness
-to make up the three million dollars.,6,1,joy
"Well, ten hours worth of minutes--",6,6,sadness
is what's going to happen.,6,5,neutral
"Ten hours? So, basically, a day's worth of minutes which I pay forty dollars a month from it.",5,6,sadness
"Sir,",6,6,sadness
So you're giving me a dollar back.,6,6,sadness
"what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-",6,6,sadness
and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.,6,6,sadness
Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.,5,1,joy
What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,5,6,sadness
"What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed.",5,5,neutral
He was out there when it happened.,6,5,neutral
"Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.",6,4,fear
What was he doing out at four in the morning?,5,5,neutral
I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,6,6,sadness
"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",6,6,sadness
"He cried hard, huh?",5,7,disgust
I could hear it right through the floor.,6,4,fear
What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again.,5,6,sadness
"Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",5,5,neutral
What's the meaning in that?,5,6,sadness
"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",3,4,fear
"Well, what do you mean? What?",5,5,neutral
Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,6,6,sadness
"What do you mean, dishonest?",5,3,anger
You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,5,6,sadness
"What, you're going to argue with him?",5,3,anger
"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.",6,6,sadness
You can't tell him that.,6,5,neutral
We got to tell him that.,6,6,sadness
We can't. It just won't work.,6,0,surprise
"You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.",6,7,disgust
They do come back.,6,6,sadness
"I know, but he doesn't know that.",6,5,neutral
Three years has been a long time.,6,6,sadness
"All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.",6,6,sadness
"It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",5,7,disgust
"All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.",6,3,anger
"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",5,6,sadness
"Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story?",5,6,sadness
I want to ask her to marry me.,6,0,surprise
"Come on, you know that's not only my business.",6,3,anger
"Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.",5,3,anger
So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,6,6,sadness
"Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.",6,6,sadness
"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",6,5,neutral
"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",6,3,anger
God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.,6,7,disgust
"Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.",6,6,sadness
And she-she's Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
"No, she is not Larry's girl.",6,6,sadness
"Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.",6,7,disgust
"If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go.",6,6,sadness
"'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?",5,3,anger
"Oh, I don't know.",6,5,neutral
What do you want from me?,5,3,anger
"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",6,0,surprise
You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,6,6,sadness
There's nothing wrong with it.,6,6,sadness
I didn't ask Annie yet.,6,6,sadness
You didn't ask her yet?,5,5,neutral
"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father?",5,5,neutral
Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,6,6,sadness
"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",5,6,sadness
"Mom, don't avoid me.",6,4,fear
"You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.",6,6,sadness
So what? I'm not fast with women.,5,5,neutral
I don't understand why it has to be her.,6,5,neutral
"That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.",6,7,disgust
I just-,6,6,sadness
"I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.",6,5,neutral
It just is. I-,6,6,sadness
"I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",5,6,sadness
"No, I don't want a diagram.",6,7,disgust
"He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?",5,7,disgust
"Okay. All right, then.",6,6,sadness
"Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.",6,6,sadness
"No, I've given it three years of thought.",6,6,sadness
And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,1,6,sadness
But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,6,6,sadness
I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,6,6,sadness
You're crazy.,6,3,anger
I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.,6,0,surprise
You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?,5,3,anger
The business. The business doesn't inspire me.,6,7,disgust
"Oh, you have to be inspired.",6,6,sadness
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,6,1,joy
"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",6,5,neutral
"Now, where do I find it?",5,5,neutral
Tell me something.,6,6,sadness
You'd leave that business.,6,3,anger
Yes. On this I would.,6,6,sadness
You can't do that.,6,3,anger
"All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.",6,3,anger
Okay. Just-,6,6,sadness
"We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.",6,6,sadness
"Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?",5,6,sadness
I'm going to.,6,6,sadness
You just can't talk like that.,6,7,disgust
"I don't know you, do I?",5,5,neutral
Yeah. I can see that.,6,6,sadness
Why did you invite her here?,5,5,neutral
Why? Does that bother you?,5,3,anger
She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,6,6,sadness
"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",6,6,sadness
You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,6,6,sadness
"What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do.",5,3,anger
"Listen, kid-",6,6,sadness
She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,6,6,sadness
Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.,5,5,neutral
"I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no.",6,6,sadness
She's waited.,6,6,sadness
"Because she thinks like me, that's why.",6,6,sadness
"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",6,7,disgust
"I think again, that I'm-I'm right.",6,6,sadness
"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",5,1,joy
"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",6,4,fear
Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.,5,3,anger
"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",6,3,anger
"Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.",6,5,neutral
"You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone.",6,4,fear
Okay. Just calm yourself.,6,6,sadness
"No, you've got to believe.",6,5,neutral
"Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe.",6,5,neutral
"Why me, above all?",5,5,neutral
Huh?,5,5,neutral
Why me above all?,5,5,neutral
You got to keep believing.,6,6,sadness
What have I got to hide?,5,6,sadness
"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",5,3,anger
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,2,6,sadness
"Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?",5,6,sadness
"No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.",6,6,sadness
It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.,2,1,joy
No. I'm not sorry. It's-,6,0,surprise
I can't stay.,6,0,surprise
"Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].",6,6,sadness
Well-,6,6,sadness
"Look,",6,3,anger
"you've been acting kind of, well, you know.",6,6,sadness
"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",6,6,sadness
"Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.",6,6,sadness
"Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.",6,6,sadness
How did you know?,5,5,neutral
"Yeah, they would. Especially your mom.",6,6,sadness
"Well, uh- would you want to?",5,5,neutral
"I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",6,6,sadness
"Well, I mean,",6,6,sadness
"Oh, Annie.",6,0,surprise
"from her opinion, why else would I come here?",5,3,anger
"Annie, I love you.",2,1,joy
I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.,2,1,joy
"Well, I guess that's why I came.",6,6,sadness
"I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.",5,7,disgust
I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.,6,6,sadness
"I've been ready for a long, long time.",6,6,sadness
Then he's gone forever. You're sure?,5,5,neutral
Look,6,6,sadness
I was almost married two years ago.,6,1,joy
'Cause you started to write me.,6,3,anger
"Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say?",5,5,neutral
You always can be so ambiguous.,6,6,sadness
"Give me a kiss, Annie.",6,6,sadness
Give me-,6,6,sadness
"[LAUGHTER]. God, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",6,5,neutral
I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,5,5,neutral
We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,1,1,joy
"Not like that, you're not.",6,6,sadness
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",6,6,sadness
What is it?,5,5,neutral
Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,6,0,surprise
No. What is it? Is it your mother?,5,5,neutral
"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",6,7,disgust
"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",6,7,disgust
"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",6,6,sadness
You should tell me.,6,6,sadness
I don't know where to start.,6,4,fear
"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",6,6,sadness
You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,6,6,sadness
Geez.,6,7,disgust
It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,6,6,sadness
"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",6,7,disgust
"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",6,5,neutral
"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",5,7,disgust
And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,6,1,joy
And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,6,5,neutral
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,6,3,anger
"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",2,7,disgust
"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",6,6,sadness
And I didn't want to take any of it.,6,7,disgust
And I guess that included you.,6,6,sadness
And you still feel that way?,5,6,sadness
"I want you now, Annie.",6,6,sadness
"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",5,7,disgust
"I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.",6,6,sadness
"Annie,",6,6,sadness
"Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.",6,1,joy
What am I going to do with a fortune?,5,6,sadness
"Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?",5,5,neutral
Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.,6,0,surprise
"You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?",5,6,sadness
"Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.",6,5,neutral
"Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?",5,5,neutral
"Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.",5,5,neutral
"Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",5,5,neutral
That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, well, sure.",6,6,sadness
"I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",5,5,neutral
"No, of course. Yours and mine. Our flashlight. Yours and mine. Mi flashlight is su flashlight. Naturally.",6,6,sadness
We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.,6,5,neutral
I hope the moon stays out.,6,6,sadness
"Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?",5,5,neutral
Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?,5,3,anger
"We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.",5,5,neutral
"You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",5,5,neutral
I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].,6,5,neutral
I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.,6,5,neutral
"It's past eleven, let's go home.",6,6,sadness
What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,5,5,neutral
"Yeah, that's my point too.",6,6,sadness
"Well, so let's go.",6,6,sadness
"No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, don't you want to see it?",5,3,anger
I don't know. I just don't.,6,6,sadness
"Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.",6,6,sadness
Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,5,6,sadness
Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.,6,6,sadness
"I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.",1,5,neutral
"Oh, God, Augie.",6,5,neutral
"What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.",6,6,sadness
"There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested.",6,5,neutral
"I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me.",6,6,sadness
I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.,6,5,neutral
And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.,6,5,neutral
"Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.",6,7,disgust
"No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.",6,5,neutral
"We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-",5,6,sadness
"no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it?",5,7,disgust
"I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",6,6,sadness
Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.,6,5,neutral
"And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",6,6,sadness
"You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.",6,6,sadness
"its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.",6,4,fear
"They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here",6,6,sadness
"where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.",6,5,neutral
"Yeah, that's the wind.",6,6,sadness
About what I just said.,6,6,sadness
About what I was just saying.,6,6,sadness
It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,6,sadness
"It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach.",6,1,joy
"Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.",6,7,disgust
Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now.,1,1,joy
I don't care. It's still fish to me.,6,7,disgust
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",5,6,sadness
"Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",5,3,anger
"Okay, then what's bugging you?",5,3,anger
"Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.",6,6,sadness
"There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.",5,7,disgust
It's not like that.,6,7,disgust
We're not seeing the grunions?,5,5,neutral
"Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come.",6,6,sadness
We missed them twice. That's not ever.,6,6,sadness
Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.,6,6,sadness
We'll see them this time.,6,6,sadness
"No, we won't.",6,6,sadness
"It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?",5,6,sadness
Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,6,6,sadness
"God, I thought you wanted to see it.",6,5,neutral
I do.,6,6,sadness
"Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.",6,6,sadness
It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.,6,6,sadness
"For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.",6,6,sadness
"I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.",6,7,disgust
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.",6,1,joy
"And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-",6,6,sadness
Do you remember the last time we came here?,5,6,sadness
We thought I was pregnant.,6,4,fear
You brought a bottle of champagne.,6,7,disgust
We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.,6,6,sadness
And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.,6,7,disgust
"Oh, that moment-that was it.",6,5,neutral
"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",1,1,joy
Wait a minute. I got it.,6,6,sadness
Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,6,4,fear
"It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.",5,6,sadness
"You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?",5,6,sadness
I don't want to remember something.,6,7,disgust
Hope for some things.,6,6,sadness
"Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?",5,6,sadness
Do you want me to get some champagne?,5,3,anger
What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,5,5,neutral
Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?,5,5,neutral
A new carpet? A poodle?,5,5,neutral
"A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",5,3,anger
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,6,6,sadness
"Jesus, welcome to the human race.",6,6,sadness
Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?,5,5,neutral
"No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.",6,1,joy
"You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.",5,3,anger
This what? What is this? This is nothing.,5,5,neutral
"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",6,6,sadness
Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,6,6,sadness
"I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but",6,6,sadness
it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,5,6,sadness
"Well, I'm doing the best I can.",6,6,sadness
"I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.",6,0,surprise
"Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.",6,6,sadness
"No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.",1,0,surprise
"Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.",6,7,disgust
"God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.",5,7,disgust
"Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.",6,6,sadness
"Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.",6,6,sadness
"Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.",6,6,sadness
I noticed that. It's beautiful.,6,1,joy
You can see right over the water.,6,6,sadness
"God, big old white moon.",6,5,neutral
You brought refreshments?,5,5,neutral
At least we won't need glasses.,6,6,sadness
Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?,5,0,surprise
So I was thinking you might be right.,6,6,sadness
Maybe this is the right place after all.,6,6,sadness
"I'm sorry, Augie.",6,0,surprise
Shh.,6,7,disgust
If we're very quiet the fish might come.,6,4,fear
"I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,6,sadness

"[LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine.",6,4,fear
"things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",5,4,fear
"Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke.",1,7,disgust
"Ooh darling, don't say that.",6,6,sadness
"You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",5,6,sadness
What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?,5,6,sadness
"[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.",2,7,disgust
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,2,6,sadness
"Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too.",6,6,sadness
"Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.",6,1,joy
"So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",5,3,anger
No. The fire will fade along with our passion.,6,0,surprise
"Oh dear, well, shall we want that?",5,6,sadness
"Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?",5,6,sadness
"Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might.",6,6,sadness
"Well, that's serious enough.",6,0,surprise
"No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.",6,6,sadness
So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,6,0,surprise
"Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",6,1,joy
"I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",5,3,anger
"Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.",2,3,anger
Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,5,4,fear
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,6,6,sadness
Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.,6,6,sadness
Horrible little thing. I hated it.,6,7,disgust
I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,6,7,disgust
The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,6,7,disgust
"Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].",6,7,disgust
yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.,6,5,neutral
The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER],6,7,disgust

"Oh, I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].",6,5,neutral
"Yeah, and very much sillier.",6,1,joy
"Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,6,sadness
Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.,5,6,sadness
I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,6,7,disgust
Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.,6,6,sadness
"No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination.",3,6,sadness
You must admit that he was in love with you.,2,1,joy
"Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.",6,0,surprise
You let him kiss you. You said so.,6,6,sadness
"Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.",6,7,disgust
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it.",6,6,sadness
"Well, it's true.",6,6,sadness
Are you bored with this conversation?,5,6,sadness
"I definitely, most definitely am.",6,6,sadness
So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?,5,0,surprise
I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,6,5,neutral
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.",6,6,sadness
I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.,6,5,neutral
"Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on.",6,5,neutral
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.,6,6,sadness
"Going somewhere, dear?",5,5,neutral
No. Just making myself fascinating for you.,6,6,sadness
"It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",5,6,sadness
"No, it's not. I don't care.",6,7,disgust
It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3,7,disgust
"Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?",5,5,neutral
"Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",6,3,anger
"Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",6,3,anger
"I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.",5,3,anger
"Uhh,",6,7,disgust
did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,5,6,sadness
"Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.",6,6,sadness
"I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",5,6,sadness
Mind your business.,6,6,sadness
You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,1,1,joy
You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,6,3,anger
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,6,7,disgust
"Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.",6,6,sadness
Do shut up. Shut up.,6,3,anger
I don't want to talk about this anymore.,6,7,disgust
You better turn that off.,6,6,sadness
It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,6,3,anger
There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,6,6,sadness
"Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.",6,6,sadness
"No, I will do no such thing.",6,3,anger
Turn it on.,6,6,sadness
You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.,6,6,sadness
I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,6,3,anger
"Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-",6,1,joy
"Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",0,4,fear
"Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",6,3,anger
"You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.",6,7,disgust
This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.,5,7,disgust
"No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, yes I am.",6,6,sadness
"Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.",6,3,anger
"Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.",6,3,anger
"I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",6,7,disgust
"Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.",6,7,disgust
"Hey listen here missy, I've been in this line for an hour and now I'm finally here.  So you're going to take my application.",6,1,joy
Is that a demand sir?,5,6,sadness

"What are you, what are you a police officer now?  You know, like I'm done, I'm over it.  Goodbye and I hope that you lose your job.",5,5,neutral
Hello.,6,6,sadness

Olivia Brown.,6,6,sadness
Alright Ms. Brown what's the nature of your problem?,5,6,sadness

Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?,5,5,neutral
"Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry.",6,0,surprise
No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.,6,6,sadness
Okay?  And it [GARBAGE]. My business is failing because my phone isn't working and I don't have a land line and I really can't handle this right now.,5,0,surprise
"Um- well it's probably easy.  Can you any more symptoms either you're not receiving calls----ok, you're not receiving calls, not getting calls.",6,6,sadness
"the symptoms- This [GARBAGE] a doctor's office. I'm not receiving calls...I can't receive- no, it's, it cuts me off--",6,0,surprise
Is the phone turned on?,5,6,sadness
Yes the phone turns on.  No I mean I'm using it not turning on the phone.  Of course it turns on.,6,6,sadness
"Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-",6,6,sadness
No- I don't have a sim card because it's Verizon and you guys don't use sim cards.,6,6,sadness
Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--,6,6,sadness
you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.,6,6,sadness
"Okay no.  Sir, this is the deal.  My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work.  That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it.",6,6,sadness
Okay.  How about this we'll send you a brand new camera phone with palm pilot-- and-,6,6,sadness
I don't know even how to use that stuff it's too complicated.  I just want my flip phone to work----that's all I need,6,6,sadness
"So we'll send it- And we'll give you, how about a free year's service?",5,6,sadness
"Look, I am on the road all the time.  Do you understand how important?  I'm a woman, a single mother by herself working...what?",5,5,neutral
Tell them my name.  My name is Brent Backersen.,6,6,sadness
"Brent Backersen, I am writing this down, Brent Backersen.  Alright.",6,6,sadness
Okay.  Tell them my - my ID number is two one three five.,6,6,sadness
"Tell them that.  You can go in, get a brand new phone, they'll hook you up with service even give you a free three months--",6,6,sadness
"I, I, I don't want a contract. Okay. I don't want any contracts.",6,3,anger
It will be free.  No contract okay?,5,6,sadness
Really?  No contract?,5,5,neutral
"Go in there, yeah, go in there.  Tell them Brent Backersen sent you.",6,6,sadness
I want the best freaking camera phone there is though.  I want the really good kind--,6,6,sadness
"the top of the line camera phone, game boy, anything you want. For free. And palm pilot.",6,6,sadness
And palm pilot.,6,6,sadness

you better promise me.,6,6,sadness
Yes.  You just tell them Brent Backersen sent you.,6,6,sadness
Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.,5,1,joy
Alright Thanks.,6,1,joy
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,5,6,sadness
"What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",6,5,neutral
About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,6,4,fear
Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?,5,5,neutral
I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.,6,0,surprise
No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,6,6,sadness
"God, what was he doing out there anyway?",5,5,neutral
Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.,6,4,fear
"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",5,5,neutral
"I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",3,4,fear
Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,6,6,sadness
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,6,6,sadness
What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?,5,3,anger
"No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.",6,6,sadness
"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",5,4,fear
That we haven't had any hope for years now?,5,6,sadness
We got to say it to him.,6,6,sadness
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,5,5,neutral
Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,6,5,neutral
"To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,",6,6,sadness
he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?,5,5,neutral
"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",6,6,sadness
No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,6,7,disgust
Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.,6,6,sadness
"You know why I asked Annie here, right?",5,6,sadness
Well I have an idea but I don't know.  What's the story?,5,6,sadness
Well that's your business Chris.,6,6,sadness
"Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",5,6,sadness
Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,6,6,sadness
"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",6,6,sadness
Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,5,3,anger
Well I'm just saying--,6,6,sadness
You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,6,6,sadness
She's not...she's Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,6,3,anger
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,6,6,sadness
"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",5,6,sadness
Because other people will suffer.,6,7,disgust
"My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.",6,3,anger
You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.,6,6,sadness
Well to hell with that.,6,3,anger
And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?,5,4,fear
Then I guess that's the end of it.,6,6,sadness
But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,6,6,sadness
"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",5,6,sadness
"Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...",5,5,neutral
Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.,5,6,sadness
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,6,5,neutral
"Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.",6,6,sadness
It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,5,6,sadness
No I don't want a diagram.,6,7,disgust
"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",5,5,neutral
Alright then.,6,6,sadness
"Look, just give it some thought okay?",5,3,anger
I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,1,6,sadness
But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,6,6,sadness
I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,6,6,sadness
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,6,0,surprise
You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,5,3,anger
The business doesn't inspire me.,6,7,disgust
Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,6,1,joy
Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?,5,5,neutral
Tell me something.  You can leave this business?,5,3,anger
Yes.  On this I would.,6,6,sadness
You can't talk like that.,6,7,disgust
Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?,5,7,disgust
"I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.",5,3,anger
I know.  Just you help me stay here.,6,6,sadness
Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.,5,7,disgust
I don't understand you do I?,5,5,neutral
No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,6,4,fear
Yeah.  I can see that.,6,6,sadness
Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,6,5,neutral
"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",6,6,sadness
Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.,6,6,sadness
uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?,5,5,neutral
Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.,6,6,sadness
Who said he even thought about that?,5,5,neutral
I see it.  It has the appearance of it.,6,6,sadness
Now listen kid...,6,3,anger
No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,6,6,sadness
"Then why is still single?  I mean there's plenty of single men in New York.  Why isn't she married by now?  Probably a hundred men has told her that she's foolish but, she's waiting.",5,5,neutral
How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?,5,5,neutral
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.",6,6,sadness
"My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",6,7,disgust
it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,6,6,sadness
Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?,5,1,joy
"No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",6,3,anger
I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.,6,6,sadness
But Kate...,6,6,sadness
But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.,5,4,fear
"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",5,6,sadness
Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.,6,6,sadness
I can't do it all alone.,6,0,surprise
"Calm yourself, alright?",5,6,sadness
"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",6,6,sadness
"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?",5,4,fear
"Look, just keep believing okay?",5,3,anger
"Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",5,5,neutral
What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,5,5,neutral
I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it?,5,6,sadness
"No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know?",5,1,joy
It's lovely here.,2,1,joy
The air is so sweet.,2,1,joy
No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,6,0,surprise
First of all your mother so much as told me to go.,6,3,anger
"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",6,7,disgust
"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",6,7,disgust
Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,6,sadness
"Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother.",6,6,sadness
"Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?",5,6,sadness
"So, would you want to?",5,6,sadness
"I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.",6,6,sadness
Oh Annie.  I love you.  I love you a great deal.,2,1,joy
I guess that's why I came.,6,6,sadness
I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.,6,6,sadness
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?,5,0,surprise
"This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me.",6,6,sadness
"Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.",6,6,sadness
"Then he's gone forever, you sure?",5,5,neutral
"Look, I almost got married two years ago.",6,5,neutral
You felt something that far back.,6,6,sadness
"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",5,6,sadness
You'd always be so ambiguous.,6,6,sadness
"Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...",6,6,sadness
"Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.",6,5,neutral
I'll never forgive you for that.,6,0,surprise
"How long, how long I've been waiting to do that.",6,6,sadness
"I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.",5,5,neutral
We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.,1,1,joy
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.,6,6,sadness
"Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",6,0,surprise
"No, what is it?  Your mother?",5,5,neutral
"No, nothing, nothing like that.",6,7,disgust
"Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.",6,0,surprise
"Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me.",6,7,disgust
Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?,5,3,anger
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,5,6,sadness
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,6,6,sadness
"For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.",6,6,sadness
"That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.",6,6,sadness
A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,6,6,sadness
"It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?",5,6,sadness
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,6,6,sadness
And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,6,5,neutral
"And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",6,7,disgust
"It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",6,0,surprise
"open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",6,6,sadness
"cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",2,6,sadness
Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,6,6,sadness
And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,6,6,sadness
Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.,5,3,anger
"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",6,6,sadness
[GARBAGE] Annie,6,6,sadness
Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.,6,1,joy
Buy some hats?,5,6,sadness
"Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?",5,5,neutral
Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.,6,6,sadness
You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?,5,4,fear
"Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.",5,5,neutral
"But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?",5,5,neutral
"Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",5,5,neutral
"You know, the flashlight, the silver one?  There's only one isn't there?",5,5,neutral
It's not your flashlight.,6,6,sadness
"Well, whose is it?",5,6,sadness
It's ours.  Mine too.,6,6,sadness
"Well, sure.",6,6,sadness
"Well, you keep saying it's my flashlight like it's only your flashlight.  I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",5,5,neutral
"No.  Of course, our flashlight.  Yours and mine.  Me flashlight is su flashlight, naturally.",6,6,sadness
How could we have not thought to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,5,5,neutral
Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember?,5,5,neutral
Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?,5,5,neutral
"We should've brought the blanket, our blanket.",6,6,sadness
"God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.",5,5,neutral
"I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]",6,5,neutral
I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,5,5,neutral
"Look, I'm cold.",6,3,anger
"It's past eleven, let's go.",6,6,sadness
What?  Are you kidding me?  We just got here.  We miss it.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,5,5,neutral
That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?,5,6,sadness
I don't know.  I just don't.,6,5,neutral
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.",6,6,sadness
"Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.",5,6,sadness
"Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.",6,6,sadness
"But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.",6,0,surprise
"What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats.",5,6,sadness
Augie.,6,6,sadness
"Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.",6,5,neutral
"I mean, I can't see how you can not be interested.",6,5,neutral
"I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.",6,5,neutral
And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.,6,5,neutral
"You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.",6,7,disgust
Okay.  We're in a good spot.,6,6,sadness
You didn't see them the first time either.,6,5,neutral
"We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.",6,6,sadness
"Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?",5,7,disgust
"You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.",5,6,sadness
"I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",6,6,sadness
"Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...",6,5,neutral
"...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",6,6,sadness
"It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.",6,6,sadness
They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.",6,6,sadness
[BREATHING] So what do you think?,5,5,neutral
About what I just said?,5,5,neutral
It certainly is not.  It's,6,6,sadness
It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,6,sadness
"It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.",6,6,sadness
I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.,6,5,neutral
"Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",1,1,joy
"Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.",6,7,disgust
It's just...,6,6,sadness
"Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.",6,6,sadness
"There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.",5,6,sadness
"For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.",6,3,anger
"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",5,5,neutral
"Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.",6,5,neutral
Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.,6,6,sadness
"Carla, can I ask you something?",5,6,sadness
"Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?",5,6,sadness
"Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.",6,3,anger
What's bugging you then?,5,5,neutral
"Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...",6,7,disgust
"Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",6,6,sadness
"God, you don't understand anything.",6,7,disgust
"I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.",6,6,sadness
"Well, we're going to see it.",6,6,sadness
"No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.",6,5,neutral

"You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem.",6,6,sadness
"Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.",6,1,joy
"And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.",6,6,sadness
"Look, do you remember the first time we came here?",5,6,sadness
We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...,6,6,sadness
Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.,6,4,fear
"And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.",1,1,joy
What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?,5,5,neutral
It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...,5,5,neutral
And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.,6,6,sadness
You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?,5,6,sadness
I'd rather not remember something...,6,7,disgust
Rather not hope for something.,6,0,surprise
"Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance?",5,6,sadness
What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,5,5,neutral
Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?,5,5,neutral
No...No...No...,6,6,sadness
No...,6,6,sadness
Welcome to the human race.,6,6,sadness
Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,5,6,sadness
I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,6,6,sadness
...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,5,1,joy
"This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.",5,3,anger
Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,6,6,sadness
No.  I know.  Me neither.,6,0,surprise
This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,5,6,sadness
I'm trying to do the best I can.,6,6,sadness
I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,6,6,sadness
I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,6,0,surprise
Maybe if you were with someone else too.,6,6,sadness
I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.,1,0,surprise
"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",6,6,sadness
If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,1,6,sadness
"Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't.",6,6,sadness
"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",6,6,sadness
It seemed like a good spot to me.,6,1,joy
I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.,6,7,disgust
Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,6,5,neutral
Big old white moon.,6,6,sadness
"Hey, look what we got here.",6,3,anger
Oh you brought refreshments.,6,6,sadness
Well at least we won't need glasses.,6,6,sadness
Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?,5,0,surprise
No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,6,6,sadness
I think this may be the place for us after all.,6,6,sadness
I am sorry Augie.,6,0,surprise
And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,6,6,sadness
Well it must be them then.,6,6,sadness
What are you going to do?,5,5,neutral
We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling.,5,6,sadness
"I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.",6,6,sadness
Hello?  Hello?  What?,5,5,neutral
That sent shivers up my spine.,6,4,fear
"No, wrong number.",6,7,disgust
What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?,5,5,neutral
Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.,6,6,sadness
um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?,5,4,fear
What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.,1,4,fear
"Oh, darling.  Don't say that.",6,4,fear
"It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.",6,7,disgust
"You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?",5,6,sadness
Yes.  I mean just that.,6,6,sadness
What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?,5,5,neutral
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want.",6,7,disgust
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.,6,6,sadness
Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,2,1,joy
So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.",6,1,joy
How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?,5,4,fear
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,6,0,surprise
"Well, dear, shall we want that?",5,6,sadness
"Well, it depends on how well we've played.",6,6,sadness
"What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?",5,5,neutral
"Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.",6,6,sadness
That's serious enough.,6,0,surprise
"No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",6,7,disgust
Darling I believe you're talking nonsense.,6,3,anger
"Oh, and who isn't talking nonsense?",5,5,neutral
Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children.,5,0,surprise
Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,6,1,joy
"I don't care what you do, you see?  As long, no I don't care what you do, see?",5,3,anger
You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,2,3,anger
Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...,2,1,joy
...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.,6,3,anger
The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,6,7,disgust
"Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully.",6,5,neutral
Horrible little thing.,6,4,fear
Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,6,0,surprise
I hated it.,6,7,disgust
How long did that rile last?,5,6,sadness
"Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you-",6,7,disgust
I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,6,7,disgust
you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,6,3,anger
That was a rouser wasn't it?,5,7,disgust
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me.,6,5,neutral
"The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers.",6,7,disgust
I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].,6,5,neutral
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",6,7,disgust
And much sillier too.,6,1,joy
The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,6,6,sadness
Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",6,3,anger
Presents?  A trivial little broach.,5,5,neutral
Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,6,7,disgust
Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,6,6,sadness
No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,3,6,sadness
You must admit he was in love with you.,2,6,sadness
Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,6,0,surprise
You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,5,3,anger
Well what of it?,5,3,anger
"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",6,6,sadness
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you would've never known anything.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",6,1,joy
"Look, I'm bored with this conversation.",6,7,disgust
"Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.",6,0,surprise
You want some brandy?,5,6,sadness
I'll have a little I think.,6,6,sadness
I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,6,5,neutral
I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,6,5,neutral
Oh my...just because I just...okay...,6,5,neutral
...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.,6,5,neutral
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,6,6,sadness
Really Amanda.,6,6,sadness
"No, just making myself beautiful for you.",6,6,sadness
That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,5,6,sadness
Actually that's perfectly true.,6,6,sadness
I think you should have some more brandy...,6,6,sadness
I think that,6,6,sadness
...cause really,6,5,neutral
it doesn't seem to be working on you.,6,5,neutral
"perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy, it might've made you a little less disagreeable.",3,6,sadness
Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you.,6,6,sadness
"Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",6,3,anger
Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,6,3,anger
I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.,5,3,anger
I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?,5,6,sadness
"Mmm, you must've had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",1,1,joy
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,6,3,anger
"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",6,6,sadness
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",6,7,disgust
"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",5,5,neutral
We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,6,6,sadness
"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",2,5,neutral
"Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",6,6,sadness
Because people upstairs will get annoyed.,3,3,anger
There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.,6,6,sadness
Well there are people downstairs I suppose.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, this is no time to be in here for Tunis.",6,0,surprise
No I'll do no such thing.,6,3,anger
Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,6,6,sadness
"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",3,3,anger
Turn it--Turn it off.,6,3,anger
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,6,3,anger
"I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",0,3,anger
"You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",5,7,disgust
"This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",5,4,fear
You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",6,4,fear
Just shut up.,6,3,anger
shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.,6,3,anger
"Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-",5,4,fear

I did exactly what they told me to do.,6,6,sadness
I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.,6,6,sadness
Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?,5,4,fear
I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?,5,6,sadness

fill out this form and wait,6,6,sadness
You're going to have to go back again.,6,6,sadness
Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,5,6,sadness
This whole area here you didn't initial,6,6,sadness

Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.,6,6,sadness
I have been waiting for over an hour.,6,6,sadness
This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place,6,6,sadness
"Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that",6,6,sadness
I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.,6,6,sadness

I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,6,5,neutral
Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,5,6,sadness
Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,6,6,sadness
I can't deal with this emotionally.,6,0,surprise
What do you want me to do?,5,3,anger
I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.,6,0,surprise

Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,6,6,sadness
I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,6,6,sadness

who- Who's getting married though?,5,5,neutral
I know but you just asked me to-,6,6,sadness
to help plan because I'm getting married. [LAUGHTER],6,6,sadness
So we're going to go greens and browns.,6,6,sadness

Just for me.  Come on.  I'm your best friend.,6,6,sadness

"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",6,6,sadness

Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,6,3,anger
What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.,6,6,sadness
If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.,6,6,sadness
We're just talking over each other.,6,6,sadness

You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.,6,3,anger
"Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,",6,6,sadness
No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,5,4,fear
terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over,6,6,sadness
The best that we can do for you is give you-,6,6,sadness

Thank you for being here.,6,1,joy
You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,6,1,joy

and now I'm talking to you.  And all I want is my money back.  That's all I'm asking for. It's not much.,6,6,sadness
Okay.  Well I'd be happy to-,1,1,joy
"If you could just give me that, then I will leave you alone. And just- if i could also- What?",5,6,sadness
"Okay, sir.  I'd be happy to help you.",1,1,joy
"Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there.",6,6,sadness
"Yeah, Beverley Hills.",6,6,sadness
"Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?",5,6,sadness
The food was prepared incorrectly.,6,6,sadness
I asked for no tomatoes.,6,3,anger
"Can you be a little more specific, sir?",5,6,sadness
"I asked for no tomatoes on six tacos.  I got tomatoes and onions on all of them,",6,5,neutral
"Um, hairs were found in three out of the six.",6,6,sadness
"Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?",5,3,anger
"Yeah.  I did and they're like you've got to take it up with corporate, and I'm like well fine.  I'll have your ass by the end of the day and so now I'm trying to do that.",6,6,sadness
"Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?",5,0,surprise
"It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.",6,6,sadness
"Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address.",6,6,sadness
"Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.",6,6,sadness
"Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now",6,6,sadness
"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.",6,3,anger
"I understand, sir.  I will explain to them what the situa-",6,6,sadness
You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.,6,5,neutral
You're right sir.  It is your particular situation but I will call the other operator.  I will explain to them what's going on. You won't have to tell your story again.,6,6,sadness
You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.,6,6,sadness
You're going to fill out a form on your desk,6,6,sadness
because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.,6,3,anger
"Okay, sir.  They- they have to-",6,6,sadness
Sir.,6,6,sadness
"Sir, they have to take down your address at the other station.  I will transfer.  I will explain everything to them.  It will all be fine.  I promise.",6,6,sadness
Cindy?,5,5,neutral
Cinnee?,5,5,neutral
Cindy.,6,6,sadness
Cindy?  Cindy what?,5,5,neutral
"Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant-",6,6,sadness
"Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check",6,7,disgust
"attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.",0,3,anger
"Alright, sir. Sir.  I'm going to transfer you to the address.",6,6,sadness
"Alright.  You know what, sir.  The customer is always right.",6,6,sadness
"You know what.  I- You know what? You know what? No, it's fine. it's fine it's fine You know what?",5,3,anger
I will go ahead and I will take- I will take,6,6,sadness
"Hey, Cindy. Cindy, look I know this is not your fault.  Do whatever you want.",6,3,anger
Send me to whatever operator. I just- You know what?  I'm just done.  I'm just done.  I've lost all hope.,5,6,sadness
"Sir, customer satisfaction is our first goal.  I will go ahead and take your number and your address down myself.",6,6,sadness
"of getting my sixteen dollars back. It fine, no honestly.",6,3,anger
"No, Cindy just don't even-look don't even.  Cuz I- look Cindy I know you don't care about me, okay.  I know that I'm just like another person who calls-",6,3,anger
Wait. But I-,6,6,sadness
But I'm giving you what you want.,6,6,sadness
No it doesn't matter.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Just send me to the next operator.  That's fine.,6,6,sadness
"Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?",5,6,sadness
Okay.  Great.,6,1,joy
What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,5,6,sadness
How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,5,5,neutral
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,6,5,neutral
"I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.",6,5,neutral
"No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",6,6,sadness
What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,5,4,fear
He's getting just like after he died.,6,0,surprise
"I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.",3,4,fear
"Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",6,6,sadness
I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,6,6,sadness
"Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",5,4,fear
For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,6,7,disgust
To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,5,6,sadness
Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,6,6,sadness
The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.,6,3,anger
"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",5,6,sadness
You know why.,6,6,sadness
Well I got an idea but what's the story?,5,6,sadness
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,6,6,sadness
Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-,6,6,sadness
Then it isn't just my business.,6,6,sadness
Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,5,3,anger
Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,6,6,sadness
"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.",6,6,sadness
"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",5,6,sadness
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.",6,3,anger
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,5,6,sadness
"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",6,6,sadness
"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.",6,6,sadness
Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,6,6,sadness
I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.,6,0,surprise
"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",5,6,sadness
"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",6,7,disgust
You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,5,3,anger
Alright then mom.,6,6,sadness
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",6,6,sadness
"and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",1,0,surprise
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.",6,6,sadness
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it.,6,0,surprise
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,5,5,neutral
"The business, the business doesn't inspire me.",6,7,disgust
"Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",6,1,joy
I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,5,0,surprise
You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,5,5,neutral
Yes on this I would.,6,6,sadness
Well you don't want to think that way.,6,7,disgust
Then you help me stay here.,6,6,sadness
Alright but don't think that way,6,6,sadness
"because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",5,3,anger
But don't think that way.  You hear me?,5,3,anger
I am thinking that way.,6,6,sadness
No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,6,4,fear
Why did he invite her?,5,3,anger
It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?,5,5,neutral
Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,6,6,sadness
What do you mean?  He was brought up next door to the girl his whole life.  Why shouldn't he want to see her again?,5,5,neutral
She's not going to marry him.,6,0,surprise
Well so what.,6,6,sadness
Listen kid.,6,6,sadness
"No, line.",6,6,sadness
"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",6,5,neutral
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?,5,5,neutral
Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,6,6,sadness
Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,6,6,sadness
"In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,7,disgust
Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?,5,1,joy
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.",6,3,anger
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",6,6,sadness
But Kate-,6,5,neutral
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",6,4,fear
"Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?",5,6,sadness
"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-",6,6,sadness
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",6,0,surprise
Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,6,5,neutral
Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.,6,6,sadness
You above all have got to believe.  You.,6,5,neutral
Just don't stop believing.,6,3,anger
"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",5,4,fear
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?,5,5,neutral
I know it went out of style didn't it?,5,6,sadness
It's okay.  It's a good thing.,6,1,joy
You know it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,2,1,joy
"Not sorry, no but I'm not staying.",6,0,surprise
"In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",6,7,disgust
You saw that and you- you've been kind of-,6,6,sadness
Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,6,0,surprise
The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,6,sadness
Wouldn't you want to?,5,3,anger
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,6,6,sadness
I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.,6,6,sadness
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I,6,0,surprise
"wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each other.",6,6,sadness
"You think this is wrong, this chair, this yard.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",6,6,sadness
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",6,6,sadness
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.",6,6,sadness
"Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.",6,5,neutral
"I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",6,5,neutral
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,5,5,neutral
"Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1,1,joy
What is it Chris?,5,6,sadness
Let's drive some place.  I want to be alone with you.,6,0,surprise
"No.  What is it Chris, your mother?",5,5,neutral
"No, nothing like that.",6,7,disgust
Well then what's wrong?  Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,5,7,disgust
Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.,6,6,sadness
There's so many things mixed up.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, gees.",6,7,disgust
It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,6,6,sadness
"For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",6,7,disgust
I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,6,6,sadness
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,6,3,anger
"And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",3,5,neutral
a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,5,6,sadness
And then I came home and it was amazing.,6,5,neutral
There was no meaning in it here.,6,7,disgust
The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again.,6,6,sadness
"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",6,0,surprise
because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,6,7,disgust
"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",6,7,disgust
I mean you can take those things out of war but,6,6,sadness
"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",2,6,sadness
Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,6,6,sadness
I guess that included you.,6,6,sadness
And do you still feel that way?,5,6,sadness
"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything",6,6,sadness
that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.,6,6,sadness
You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.,6,6,sadness
"Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.",6,1,joy
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.,5,5,neutral
"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid to miss it.  How you doing?",5,4,fear
"Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell",5,5,neutral
"although if you can't tell, it probably isn't them.  It will probably be unmistakable.  Don't you think?  How you doing?",5,5,neutral
"Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.",5,5,neutral
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",5,5,neutral
It's not yours.,6,6,sadness
Well sure.,6,6,sadness
You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?,5,5,neutral
"No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?",5,5,neutral
I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?,5,5,neutral
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",5,5,neutral
"Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",5,5,neutral
"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?",5,5,neutral
It's after eleven let's go home.,6,6,sadness
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,5,5,neutral
So let's go home.,6,6,sadness
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",5,3,anger
Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,6,6,sadness
Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,6,6,sadness
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",5,6,sadness
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",6,6,sadness
This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,6,0,surprise
What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,5,5,neutral
Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do,6,6,sadness
"like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic",6,6,sadness
a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.,6,5,neutral
I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,1,5,neutral
Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions.,6,0,surprise
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.,6,6,sadness
"I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.",5,5,neutral
"Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",6,1,joy
Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,6,5,neutral
No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,6,6,sadness
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,6,6,sadness
It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,6,6,sadness
They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,6,6,sadness
where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,6,6,sadness
"Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",6,6,sadness
Well so what do you think?,5,6,sadness
What I said.,6,6,sadness
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,6,5,neutral
I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,6,7,disgust
"Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",1,1,joy
Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,6,0,surprise
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period?",5,6,sadness
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,6,3,anger
Well then what's bugging you?,5,3,anger
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,6,6,sadness
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",6,6,sadness
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",6,6,sadness
We totally skipped. Right.,6,6,sadness
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",6,6,sadness
"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",6,6,sadness
We never do.  Do we have we ever?,5,6,sadness
We've missed them twice that's not ever.,6,6,sadness
Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,6,6,sadness
We'll see them this year.,6,6,sadness
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.",6,6,sadness
"God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,",6,1,joy
and the fish won't show up.,6,0,surprise
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.,6,6,sadness
It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.,6,6,sadness
I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,6,7,disgust
Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.,6,1,joy
"Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.",6,6,sadness
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.,5,6,sadness
We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,6,5,neutral
"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",6,7,disgust
right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,6,6,sadness
"And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,1,joy
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",6,4,fear
"It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?",5,6,sadness
"That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.",5,6,sadness
I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,6,6,sadness
Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?,5,6,sadness
You want me to get some champagne?,5,3,anger
No.  No.,6,6,sadness
Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?,5,5,neutral
Want to get married again?,5,0,surprise
What?  What do you want a divorce?,5,5,neutral
"A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?",5,5,neutral
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,6,6,sadness
Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.,6,6,sadness
"Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.",6,6,sadness
Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,6,5,neutral
"No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",6,6,sadness
"Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,",6,6,sadness
"you know what you get Carla, this.",6,6,sadness
"This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.",5,5,neutral
"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,6,sadness
But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,6,6,sadness
"No, I know me either.",6,6,sadness
"This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",5,6,sadness
"I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",6,5,neutral
"No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.",1,0,surprise
"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",6,3,anger
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,5,3,anger
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,1,1,joy
"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",6,6,sadness
Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.,6,6,sadness
I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.,6,5,neutral
I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.,6,7,disgust
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",6,5,neutral
Well look at what we got here.,6,7,disgust
"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",6,6,sadness
Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,6,6,sadness
You still cold?  Do you want to go home?,5,5,neutral
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.,6,0,surprise
Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,6,6,sadness
Well what are we going to do?,5,6,sadness
"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",5,6,sadness
Hello.  Hello.  What?  Wrong number.,5,5,neutral
Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.,6,4,fear
Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.,6,6,sadness
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",5,4,fear
What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,1,4,fear
"Don't say that, my darling.",6,6,sadness
It's true the whole business is very poor joke.,6,7,disgust
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love.,2,7,disgust
What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean?,5,5,neutral
"You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want.",6,3,anger
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.,6,3,anger
"Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths",6,1,joy
flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,2,6,sadness
"If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",6,1,joy
Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright.,6,1,joy
"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?",5,3,anger
Well who knows?,5,6,sadness
We always want to bicker and fight.,6,3,anger
No that fire will fade long with our passion.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, dear shall we like that?",5,6,sadness
It all depends on how well we've played.,6,6,sadness
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?,5,6,sadness
Yes.  Yes.  with all his might.,6,6,sadness
"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",6,6,sadness
So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,6,0,surprise
Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.,1,6,sadness
Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,6,1,joy
"I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over",6,3,anger
and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,2,4,fear
"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",2,3,anger
Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,5,4,fear
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.",6,6,sadness
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,6,7,disgust
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",6,0,surprise
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,6,7,disgust
It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,6,7,disgust
"Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it?",5,7,disgust
You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard.,6,6,sadness
Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,6,7,disgust
I shall never forget his face.,6,6,sadness
"There was nothing in that, you know that.",6,6,sadness
Presents a trivial little broach.,6,7,disgust
I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,6,7,disgust
I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,3,6,sadness
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",5,6,sadness
"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",2,0,surprise
So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?,5,0,surprise
"I'll have some myself, I think.",6,6,sadness
I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,6,5,neutral
No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones.,6,6,sadness
seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,7,disgust
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,6,6,sadness
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, don't be so stupid.",6,3,anger
"Going somewhere, my dear?",5,5,neutral
Just making myself fascinating for you.,6,6,sadness
"Ah, that reply has broken my heart.",6,0,surprise
The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, no it isn't",6,5,neutral
It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3,6,sadness
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,6,6,sadness
"Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",6,3,anger
Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,6,3,anger
"I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",5,3,anger
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,6,6,sadness
"You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow.",1,1,joy
I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,6,6,sadness
"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",6,7,disgust
Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, shut up.",6,3,anger
"They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots.",6,6,sadness
Very good idea.  I will.,6,1,joy
You'd better turn that off I think.,6,6,sadness
There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,6,6,sadness
There are people downstairs I suppose.,6,6,sadness
You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,6,3,anger
"Go away, go away.  I hate you.",6,3,anger
"Amanda, listen.",6,6,sadness
Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.,5,4,fear
Stop.,6,3,anger
Very amusing.,6,1,joy
"Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",5,3,anger
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",6,7,disgust
"This is the end do you understand?  The end,",5,6,sadness
finally and forever,6,6,sadness
"Oh, I am.  Let go of me.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.",5,3,anger
Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,6,3,anger
"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",6,7,disgust
I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,6,0,surprise
"Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.",6,6,sadness
Okay.  What's the problem?,5,3,anger
"And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form",6,6,sadness
"that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.",6,6,sadness
"Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?",5,6,sadness
"Yes, I do.",6,6,sadness
Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.,6,0,surprise
"This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.",6,6,sadness
"I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.",6,6,sadness
Don't you -- you don't have-,6,3,anger
are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?,5,5,neutral
I don't have any of,6,6,sadness
I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.,6,6,sadness
"But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--",6,7,disgust
"Nope, I don't. I don't have-",6,6,sadness
or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.,6,6,sadness
"No, I can't. That's-",6,4,fear
I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.,6,0,surprise
"Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--",6,3,anger
"Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need",6,6,sadness
look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not,5,5,neutral
"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,",6,0,surprise
but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to,6,6,sadness
What if I pay you money?,5,3,anger
"Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?",5,6,sadness
twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.,5,6,sadness
"Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --",5,4,fear
"Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.",6,0,surprise
"I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.",6,7,disgust
"And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.",6,6,sadness
Well I just -- I can't do that right -- can you please just grab the form? All you have to do is grab the form.  I'm not gonna ask anything else of you.,5,6,sadness
I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.,6,6,sadness
That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-,6,6,sadness
"Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk",6,6,sadness
It's not rocket science.,6,6,sadness
"Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there.",6,6,sadness
I know it's right over there.,6,6,sadness
Why are you being such a bitch?,5,3,anger
"I'm sorry, but I can't do that.",6,0,surprise
"Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?",5,6,sadness
So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.,6,6,sadness
Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,5,0,surprise
"Fine, which line is it?",5,3,anger
The one you just came from.,6,6,sadness
"Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.",6,6,sadness
Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.,6,1,joy
It's only going to be a year.,6,6,sadness
It's the first year of your child's life.,6,1,joy
There's really -- there's nothing I can do.,6,0,surprise
You're just fine with this?,5,3,anger
There's nothing I --,6,6,sadness
You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?,5,7,disgust
"It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.",6,6,sadness
"When you get back, think of all of the things that you're going to have missed.",6,6,sadness
"I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives.",6,6,sadness
Don't go.,6,3,anger
I can't do that.  I have to go.,6,0,surprise
"Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.",5,5,neutral
I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.,3,0,surprise
"You've made a pledge to us, too.  Remember that day, we stood in front of each other and said 'til death do us part.  Put on some rings and it's supposed to mean something.",3,6,sadness
I know that. I know that. I know that.,6,6,sadness
"There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.",6,0,surprise

Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?,5,6,sadness
It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that.,6,7,disgust
"Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand",5,6,sadness
Because it's impossible.  There's -- I just can't.  I can't.,6,0,surprise
You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?,5,5,neutral
Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.,6,6,sadness
"Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.",6,6,sadness
It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life.,6,0,surprise
"And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?",5,6,sadness
I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year,6,0,surprise
Then why do you have to go a year at all?,5,5,neutral
Because I've already agreed to that.,6,6,sadness
Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.,6,0,surprise
"Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.",6,6,sadness
This is supposed to be a partnership.  We're supposed to do this together. I'm not supposed to be left here to do this by myself while you leave.,6,6,sadness
It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.,6,6,sadness
"What am I supposed to do, read your letters?",5,5,neutral
What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.,5,4,fear
"There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.",6,6,sadness
We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.,6,6,sadness

"Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.",5,3,anger
Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?,5,3,anger
I've asked already.  I can't go back.,6,0,surprise

They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.,6,0,surprise
"It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.",6,6,sadness
Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.,5,3,anger
Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.,6,6,sadness
"I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.",6,6,sadness
"Look, I--",6,3,anger
You're not really giving me a lot of options.,6,6,sadness
Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.,6,6,sadness
But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.,6,6,sadness

All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,6,6,sadness

"Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.",5,4,fear
We've gotta say it to him.,6,6,sadness
"For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",6,7,disgust
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?",5,6,sadness
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",6,0,surprise
"The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.  So we have to keep--",6,6,sadness
"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",5,6,sadness
"Well I've got an idea, but what's the story?",5,6,sadness
Going to ask her to marry me.,6,1,joy
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?,5,6,sadness
Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --,6,6,sadness
"Well, then you know it's not only my business.",6,6,sadness
"Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",5,3,anger
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,6,6,sadness
"From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.",6,6,sadness
"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",6,6,sadness
Now what can I do for you?,5,3,anger
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",6,3,anger
"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.",5,6,sadness
"The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.",6,6,sadness
So what?  I'm not fast with women.,5,5,neutral
"Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.",5,3,anger
Line?,5,5,neutral
"Alright, then, mom.",6,6,sadness
"Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.",5,6,sadness
Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,5,6,sadness
"Yeah, let's keep going.",6,6,sadness
I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,6,6,sadness
"father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",1,0,surprise
I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York.,6,6,sadness
I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.,6,6,sadness
"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",6,1,joy
I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,5,0,surprise
You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business?,5,5,neutral
You don't want to think like that.,6,7,disgust
"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",5,3,anger
I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,6,6,sadness
"But don't think that way, you hear me?",5,3,anger
"Yeah, I can see that.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, God, line.",6,5,neutral
"Why does- why, does that bother you?",5,5,neutral
"She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",6,5,neutral
"Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.",6,6,sadness
What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?,5,5,neutral
Well so what?,5,5,neutral
Line.,6,6,sadness
"Now listen, kid. Now, listen.",6,3,anger
"Oh.  Now listen, kid.",6,6,sadness
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",5,5,neutral
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",6,7,disgust
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",6,3,anger
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",6,6,sadness
"But, Kate--",6,6,sadness
Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,5,6,sadness
She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,6,0,surprise
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone",6,0,surprise
"Only last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.",6,5,neutral
"Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.",6,6,sadness
"You, above all, have got to believe.  You.",6,6,sadness
"I know.  It went out of style, didn't it?",5,6,sadness
"It's okay.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's lovely here and the air is sweet.",2,1,joy
So you're not sorry you came?,5,5,neutral
"No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.",6,0,surprise
You saw that and then you've been kind of--,6,6,sadness
The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,6,sadness
"I knew they would, your mother, anyway.",6,6,sadness
"From her point of view, why else would I come?",5,3,anger
Well wouldn't you want to?,5,3,anger
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.,6,0,surprise
I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other.,6,6,sadness
"You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",5,4,fear
Then he's gone forever?  You're sure?,5,5,neutral
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.",5,6,sadness
"Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a -",6,6,sadness
"I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.",6,5,neutral
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,5,5,neutral
"Anne, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1,1,joy
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?",5,6,sadness
Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.,6,0,surprise
"No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?",5,5,neutral
"No, no, nothing like that.",6,7,disgust
"Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",6,7,disgust
"Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",6,6,sadness
It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,6,6,sadness
"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",6,6,sadness
"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",5,7,disgust
a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,5,5,neutral
"There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",6,7,disgust
because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,6,0,surprise
"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",2,5,neutral
"You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",6,6,sadness
"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.",6,6,sadness
"And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",6,6,sadness
"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",6,1,joy
"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better.",5,5,neutral
"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?",5,4,fear
"Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",5,5,neutral
"How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.",5,5,neutral
"The flashlight; the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",5,5,neutral
"It's ours.  It's mine, too.",6,6,sadness
You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?,5,5,neutral
"No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.",5,6,sadness
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?",5,5,neutral
"Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.",6,5,neutral
I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,6,5,neutral
You want my jacket?,5,5,neutral
It's after eleven; let's go home.,6,6,sadness
"That's my point, too.",6,6,sadness
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",6,6,sadness
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.",5,6,sadness
"Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.",6,6,sadness
There's mystery here and magic.,6,6,sadness
What are you so excited about?,5,5,neutral
"Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.",6,0,surprise
This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,6,7,disgust
"Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.",6,6,sadness
There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,6,5,neutral
"I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.",1,5,neutral
"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",6,7,disgust
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -,5,5,neutral
"no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",5,7,disgust
Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;,6,5,neutral
"just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.",6,6,sadness
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,6,6,sadness
"They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",6,6,sadness
Well so what did you think?,5,5,neutral
"Look at this, goose bumps.",6,6,sadness
Well so what'd you think?,5,5,neutral
Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,6,sadness
Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.,1,1,joy
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?",5,6,sadness
"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",6,3,anger
Well what's bugging you?,5,3,anger
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",6,6,sadness
"For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions.",6,7,disgust
That's not ever.,6,6,sadness
Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,6,6,sadness
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",6,0,surprise
You don't have any idea what I'm saying.,6,5,neutral
"No, of course, not.",6,6,sadness
"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",6,0,surprise
It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.,6,6,sadness
"I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.",6,7,disgust
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.",6,1,joy
"Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;",6,6,sadness
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?,5,5,neutral
"uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.",6,6,sadness
Uh.,6,6,sadness
"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",6,6,sadness
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,1,joy
Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,6,4,fear
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.",5,6,sadness
Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?,5,6,sadness
You want to get some champagne?,5,5,neutral
"What, you want a divorce?",5,5,neutral
"A new carpet?  A poodle?  An ice cream?  A back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What, Carla?  What the hell do you want?",5,5,neutral
"Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",5,6,sadness
"No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.",6,6,sadness
"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",5,1,joy
"Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,6,sadness
"No, I know, me neither.",6,6,sadness
"This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",5,6,sadness
"I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",6,5,neutral
"Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?",5,6,sadness
"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",6,3,anger
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,5,6,sadness
"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",6,6,sadness
"Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.",6,5,neutral
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.",5,5,neutral
"Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",6,6,sadness

"I don't care, then.",6,7,disgust
"Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number.",5,5,neutral
"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",6,4,fear
With the mo- with the most perfect poise?,5,6,sadness
Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.,6,6,sadness
"Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they?",5,4,fear
But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,1,4,fear
"Don't say that, darling.",6,6,sadness
"What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,5,neutral
"You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.",2,3,anger
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.,2,1,joy
"If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",6,1,joy
Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.,6,1,joy
"How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?",5,3,anger
"Oh, dear.  Should we like that.",2,6,sadness
"What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?",5,6,sadness
"Yes.  Yes, with all his might.",6,6,sadness
"No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",6,7,disgust
"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.",1,0,surprise
"Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",6,1,joy
"I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",5,3,anger
"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.",2,3,anger
The one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed?,5,5,neutral
"Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.",6,5,neutral
I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,6,0,surprise
"It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.",6,7,disgust
How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?,5,5,neutral
"The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",2,7,disgust
"Ah, I shall never forget his face.",6,6,sadness

Yes.  We were very much younger then.,6,6,sadness
"The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",2,7,disgust
Presents?  A trivial little brooch.,5,5,neutral
"I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,7,disgust

Let him kiss you.,6,7,disgust
So am I; bored stiff.,6,0,surprise
"I'll have a little myself, I think.",6,6,sadness
"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones.",6,6,sadness
It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,6,7,disgust
"Really, Amanda",6,5,neutral
"Going out somewhere, my dear?",5,5,neutral
"No, just making myself fascinating for you",6,6,sadness
Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.,6,0,surprise

"Oh, no, it isn't.",6,7,disgust
It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.,6,0,surprise
It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3,6,sadness
"Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",6,3,anger
"They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",6,3,anger
I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.,5,3,anger
"Yes, I did, quite a lot.",6,6,sadness
"I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?",5,6,sadness
You must have had a riotous time.,6,3,anger
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",1,1,joy
You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.,6,3,anger
I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.,6,6,sadness
Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?,5,6,sadness
"We might get up a splendid little- a splendid little debate about this, you know, intemperate tots.",6,1,joy
Very good idea.  I will,6,1,joy
You better turn that off I think.,6,6,sadness
It's late and the people upstairs will get annoyed.,3,6,sadness

wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.,6,3,anger

Are you sure?,5,5,neutral
I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--,6,6,sadness

"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",6,1,joy
That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,6,6,sadness
"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",6,6,sadness
"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",6,6,sadness
"Right. Yes, ma'am.",6,6,sadness
And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,6,6,sadness
"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",6,6,sadness
"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",5,5,neutral
"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",5,5,neutral
"Well, my hands are really tied then.",6,6,sadness
Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,5,5,neutral
"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",6,6,sadness
"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",6,6,sadness
"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",5,6,sadness
Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,3,0,surprise
"Uh, so it was really heavy.",6,7,disgust

There's nothing else you can do?,5,6,sadness
"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",6,0,surprise
I don't believe that for a second.,6,5,neutral
Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,6,5,neutral
"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",6,6,sadness
"No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.",6,6,sadness
"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-",6,6,sadness

"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",5,6,sadness
"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",6,6,sadness
And you have no guarantee.,6,6,sadness
"I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",6,6,sadness
How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,5,3,anger
"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",6,6,sadness
"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",5,6,sadness
"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",5,3,anger
"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",6,7,disgust
"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",6,6,sadness
It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,6,6,sadness
"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",6,0,surprise
"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",2,0,surprise

"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",6,6,sadness
"well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.",6,6,sadness

"Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?",5,1,joy
"Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!",5,3,anger
"All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",5,3,anger
I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.,6,6,sadness

She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?,5,5,neutral
Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,6,6,sadness
"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",5,3,anger
How do you know he is even thinking about it?,5,5,neutral
"Well, so what.",6,6,sadness
"Now, listen, Kate, just-",6,3,anger
She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,6,6,sadness
"She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",5,5,neutral
Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.,6,7,disgust
Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?,5,1,joy
"Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.",6,4,fear
What do you want me to do? What do you want--,5,3,anger
I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,5,3,anger
"But, Kate...",6,6,sadness

Calm yourself!,5,3,anger

"No, it's good.",6,1,joy
It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.,2,1,joy
No.  But I'm not going to stay.,6,0,surprise
Well your mother has much as told me to leave.,6,6,sadness
Well--,6,6,sadness
"Well, you saw that! And you.  You've been-",5,5,neutral
Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.,6,7,disgust
Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.,6,6,sadness
I figured they would- your mother at least.,6,6,sadness
"Well, from her point of view why else would I come?",5,6,sadness
"Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.",5,6,sadness
"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!",5,1,joy
"I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.",6,5,neutral

"Annie, why didn't you say something to me?",5,3,anger
Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.,5,5,neutral
"Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-",6,6,sadness
Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.,5,5,neutral
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!,5,5,neutral
"Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1,1,joy
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?",5,6,sadness
Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.,6,0,surprise
"No, what is it, your mother?",5,3,anger
"What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.",5,7,disgust
"It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-",6,6,sadness
Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.,5,5,neutral
yeah sure.,6,6,sadness
Yeah.  I lost them.,6,0,surprise
how many?,5,5,neutral
just about all.,6,6,sadness
Oh gee.,6,5,neutral
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,6,6,sadness
"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",6,6,sadness
"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",6,7,disgust
I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,6,3,anger
"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",6,3,anger
"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",5,5,neutral
And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,6,6,sadness
And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,6,5,neutral
"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",6,4,fear
And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,6,7,disgust
"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",5,7,disgust
"And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you.",5,7,disgust
Do you still feel like that?,5,6,sadness
"I I want you now, Annie.",6,6,sadness
"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",5,3,anger
"Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",5,1,joy
"What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--",5,5,neutral
actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?,5,4,fear
"Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?",5,5,neutral

It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.,6,6,sadness
"Well, Sure.",6,6,sadness

yes.,6,6,sadness
"Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?",5,5,neutral
"I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.",6,5,neutral
[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around,6,5,neutral
I am cold.,6,0,surprise
you want my jacket?,5,5,neutral
"Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here, what's the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave.",5,5,neutral
There is no point in coming out here.,6,6,sadness
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",5,3,anger
I just don't.,6,6,sadness
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",6,1,joy
"Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.",6,5,neutral
"Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.",5,5,neutral
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.",6,6,sadness
This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah,6,1,joy
"What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.",5,5,neutral
"Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.",6,6,sadness
There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.,6,5,neutral
I am just not.,6,6,sadness
"I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.",1,5,neutral
"Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",6,7,disgust
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things.,6,6,sadness
"Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?",5,5,neutral
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.",6,1,joy
"Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.",6,5,neutral
It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.,6,6,sadness
"They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.",6,6,sadness
"Well, So what do you think?",5,6,sadness
What I was just saying.,6,6,sadness
It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,6,6,sadness
"It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach.",6,6,sadness
"I am not the only one, look at all these people.",6,7,disgust
"Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start",1,1,joy
I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.,6,0,surprise
"Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?",5,3,anger
"God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.",5,7,disgust
What's bugging you?,5,5,neutral
I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.,6,6,sadness

"Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.",6,6,sadness
Well We will see them this year.,6,6,sadness
"No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.",6,4,fear
"I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.",6,6,sadness
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.",6,6,sadness
"Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.",6,7,disgust
"When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.",6,1,joy
"Right, so I am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage.",6,6,sadness
"Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",5,5,neutral
"We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.",6,6,sadness
"And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",1,1,joy
"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.",5,6,sadness
I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.,6,6,sadness
"Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?",5,3,anger

What? What You want a divorce?,5,5,neutral
No no.,6,6,sadness

I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.,6,6,sadness
What.  Welcome to the human race.,6,6,sadness
"You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.",5,5,neutral
"No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.",6,1,joy
Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.,5,5,neutral
"Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,6,sadness
But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.,6,6,sadness
"I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.",6,0,surprise
Maybe if you are with somebody else too?,5,6,sadness
"No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.",1,0,surprise
"For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.",6,1,joy
"For heaven's sake, don't you know that?",5,3,anger
"Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.",1,6,sadness
"Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",6,6,sadness
Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.,6,6,sadness
I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.,6,5,neutral
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.",6,6,sadness
"Well, look what we have got here.",6,7,disgust
"Well, it's not champagne.",6,6,sadness
Well than we don't need glasses.,6,6,sadness
Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?,5,5,neutral
"No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.",6,6,sadness
"Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",6,4,fear
You think it's them?,5,5,neutral
"Freda is the only one who knows we're up here, and she wouldn't call up.",6,6,sadness

Um... It's a pity that one can't stay this way forever.,6,0,surprise
The whole business is really rather ridiculous.,6,7,disgust
Meaning exactly that.,6,6,sadness
"What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",5,5,neutral
Don't laugh at me; I'm serious.,6,3,anger
"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.",2,1,joy
"Well, if I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",6,1,joy
Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].,6,1,joy
"Well, what if-what happens when our love-",2,4,fear
"How long will it last, this overbearing love of ours?",5,6,sadness
"No, that fire will fade along with our passion.",6,6,sadness
It all depends on how well we played.,6,6,sadness
"Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?",5,6,sadness
"Well, that's rather serious, isn't it?",5,7,disgust
"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",6,6,sadness
"My dear, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",2,3,anger
"no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --",6,0,surprise
enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.,1,1,joy
"Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",6,7,disgust
"I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.",2,3,anger
"Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",2,3,anger
Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,6,6,sadness
"Horrible thing, I hate it.",6,7,disgust
I know.  You threw him out the window into the canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,6,0,surprise
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,6,7,disgust
"Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom, too.",6,7,disgust
"Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?",5,7,disgust
"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",6,6,sadness
And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,6,7,disgust
[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous",6,7,disgust
"Oh, we were very much younger then.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",6,6,sadness
You knew there was nothing.,6,5,neutral
I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,6,1,joy
Only a trivial little broach.,6,6,sadness
"I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste.",6,7,disgust
"No, not at all.  I-I still have it.  I wear it quite often.",6,6,sadness
You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,6,6,sadness
"maybe just a little, but--",6,6,sadness
And what of it?,5,5,neutral
"Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.",6,1,joy

I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.,6,0,surprise
"So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?",5,0,surprise
I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.,6,5,neutral
"No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones.",6,6,sadness
"Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.",6,7,disgust
You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.,6,6,sadness
It's becoming a habit with you.,6,7,disgust
You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,6,6,sadness
"Oh, that reply has broken my heart.",6,0,surprise
It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?,5,4,fear
"As a matter of fact, that is perfectly true.",6,6,sadness
"No, it's not.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, yes it is.",6,6,sadness
"Oh, Do shut up.",6,3,anger
It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3,6,sadness
"Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",6,6,sadness
"Well, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",6,3,anger
"adder don't snap, they sting.",6,3,anger
"Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",6,3,anger
"I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.",6,3,anger
Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?,5,6,sadness
"Yes, I did quite a bit.",6,6,sadness
"You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.",1,1,joy
"Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.",2,3,anger
I'm not the least bit drunk.,6,7,disgust
I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.,6,6,sadness
"Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",6,7,disgust
"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?  How about a child of nine?",5,5,neutral
"Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.",6,3,anger
"Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.",6,1,joy
"Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.",2,5,neutral
"Oh, very good idea.  I will.",6,1,joy
Ugh.,6,7,disgust
It's very late and it will disturb the people upstairs.,6,3,anger
There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,6,6,sadness
"Well, there are people downstairs I suppose.",6,6,sadness
It is not time of year for Tunis.,6,6,sadness
Turn it on again.,6,6,sadness
"Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.",6,3,anger
Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.,3,4,fear
"Well, do try to control yourself darling.",6,6,sadness
You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.,6,6,sadness
I- I hate you.,6,3,anger
Amanda-- Listen- Listen-,6,6,sadness
I hate you.,6,3,anger
"No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.",6,7,disgust
Very music- amusing indeed.,6,1,joy
"Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.",6,1,joy
"You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.",6,7,disgust
"Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.",5,5,neutral
"Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",6,3,anger

I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.",6,6,sadness
This happens every two weeks?,5,6,sadness

"Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?",5,6,sadness
"Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.",6,6,sadness
"Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?",5,6,sadness
Hmm. Mmm.,6,6,sadness

"It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.",6,6,sadness
"Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.",5,4,fear
"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.",6,7,disgust
"Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --",5,6,sadness

"Uh huh, Okay.",6,6,sadness
Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?,5,5,neutral
"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.",6,6,sadness
"It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",6,6,sadness
"what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week?",5,6,sadness
"Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --",6,6,sadness
Wow.  That would be amazing.  Really?,5,5,neutral
"Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.",6,3,anger
"Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.",6,5,neutral

"I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen.",0,7,disgust
"What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.",5,6,sadness
"I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",3,4,fear
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,5,6,sadness
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.,6,6,sadness
"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",5,4,fear
We have to say it to him.,6,6,sadness
how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?,5,5,neutral
For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!,5,5,neutral
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?",5,6,sadness
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",6,5,neutral
"All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?",5,6,sadness
"Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?",5,6,sadness
"Well, that's your business, Chris.",6,6,sadness
It's not just my business.,6,6,sadness
"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.",5,6,sadness
So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?,5,6,sadness
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't --",6,6,sadness
"Oh, so it isn't just my business?",5,6,sadness
You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.,5,3,anger
"Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",5,7,disgust
"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",6,6,sadness
She is not Larry's girl!,5,5,neutral
"From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?",5,6,sadness
"I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.",6,3,anger
"Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that",6,6,sadness
I wanted to get this taken care of first.,6,6,sadness
"Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?",5,4,fear
"Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",5,6,sadness
"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",6,6,sadness
"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",6,5,neutral
"Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.",6,6,sadness
"I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",5,6,sadness
"No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.",5,3,anger
"All right then, mom.",6,6,sadness
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",1,1,joy
"But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",6,6,sadness
"I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.",6,6,sadness
I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,6,0,surprise
"What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?",5,5,neutral
"Yes.  On this, I would.",6,6,sadness
You can't think like that.,6,7,disgust
"Well, you help me stay here.",6,6,sadness
"All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",5,3,anger
"I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.",6,6,sadness
Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?,5,3,anger
"What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",5,5,neutral
About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.,6,5,neutral
What was he doing out here four in the morning?,5,5,neutral

"Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",3,4,fear
"What are you gonna do, argue with him?",5,3,anger
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean,6,6,sadness
"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?",5,4,fear
"Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?",5,5,neutral
"For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!",5,5,neutral

You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?,5,6,sadness
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--",6,7,disgust
"All right.  All right, just listen.",6,6,sadness
"You know why I invited Annie, right?",5,6,sadness
"What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.",5,3,anger
So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?,5,6,sadness

"Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",5,6,sadness
"As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead.  And she's still his girl.",6,6,sadness
"Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",6,3,anger
"Well, you're a considerate fella.  There's nothing wrong with that.",6,6,sadness
what to hell with that!,5,3,anger
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.",5,6,sadness
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it seems like she's forgotten him.",6,6,sadness
"I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",5,6,sadness
"So what, I'm not fast with women?",5,6,sadness
"Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.",6,6,sadness
"[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,",6,7,disgust
"she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",5,6,sadness
"No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.",6,3,anger
"Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",5,3,anger

"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it.",6,6,sadness
But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?,5,3,anger
"Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.",6,1,joy
"I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it?",5,6,sadness
"All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.",5,3,anger
"I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.",6,6,sadness
"Don't think like that, do you hear me?",5,3,anger
"Well, I am thinking like that.",6,6,sadness
"She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?",5,5,neutral
"Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.",6,6,sadness
"What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.",5,3,anger
Why do you think he's even thinking that?,5,5,neutral
He's got that about it.,6,6,sadness
"No.  She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",6,6,sadness
You don't know.  You can't read her mind.,6,5,neutral
"Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.",5,5,neutral
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",6,7,disgust
"Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?",5,3,anger
"Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",6,3,anger
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?",5,4,fear
"I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.",6,6,sadness
But Kate?,5,5,neutral
"No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!",5,3,anger
But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.,5,5,neutral
Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,6,5,neutral
All right.  All right.,6,6,sadness

It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,2,1,joy
"So, you're not sorry I came?",5,5,neutral
"Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.",6,6,sadness
You saw that.  And well you've been --,6,6,sadness
You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.,6,7,disgust
"Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.",6,6,sadness
"I figured they would, your mother at least.",6,6,sadness
"Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?",5,3,anger
"Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.",5,6,sadness
"Yes, that's why I came.",6,6,sadness
"Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I",2,1,joy
"I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God, I'm embarrassing you. I-I didn't want to do this here. I- I wanted to do it someplace different, someplace where we could be new to each other.",6,5,neutral

"It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.",6,6,sadness
"For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.",6,6,sadness
I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.,6,6,sadness
"I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",6,7,disgust
"Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?",5,5,neutral
"And and to see that again, to to bring that back on the earth again, like- like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them.",6,1,joy
It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,6,5,neutral
"I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.",6,7,disgust
So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.,6,6,sadness
"I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",6,7,disgust
"It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,",6,7,disgust
"you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.",2,6,sadness
"Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",6,6,sadness

Annie I am going to make you a fortune.,6,1,joy
"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?",5,4,fear
"What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",5,5,neutral
"This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.",5,5,neutral

"How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?",5,5,neutral
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.",5,5,neutral

It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.,6,6,sadness

"Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it?",5,4,fear
it's stupid.,6,3,anger
"Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.",6,6,sadness
Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,5,6,sadness
"Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,",6,1,joy
"and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.",6,6,sadness
"I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.",6,6,sadness
"What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.",1,5,neutral
"All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.",6,5,neutral
"I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.",1,5,neutral
"Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.",6,7,disgust
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.,6,6,sadness
"Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.",5,5,neutral
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;",6,1,joy
somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-,6,5,neutral
"And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,",6,6,sadness
"they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.",6,1,joy
It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.,6,6,sadness
"I'm not the only one, look at all these people.",6,7,disgust
"Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",1,1,joy
"I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.",6,6,sadness
"uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?",5,5,neutral
"God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.",5,3,anger
I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.,6,6,sadness
"It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.",6,4,fear
"For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion.",6,0,surprise
We We don't ever.  Have we ever?,5,5,neutral
We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.,6,6,sadness
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",6,6,sadness
"No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.",6,1,joy
"Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.",6,6,sadness
I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,6,6,sadness
"I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --",6,6,sadness
"you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.",6,1,joy
Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,5,6,sadness
"And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",1,1,joy
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",6,4,fear
"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?",5,6,sadness
I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.,6,6,sadness
"Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um, listen.  Do you want to dance?",5,6,sadness
"What, you want me to blow in your ear?",5,3,anger

"A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?",5,5,neutral
I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,6,6,sadness
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?",5,6,sadness
"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",5,1,joy
"Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",5,6,sadness
This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,5,5,neutral
"Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",6,6,sadness
But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.,6,6,sadness
"Now, I know.  Me either",6,6,sadness
"This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?",5,6,sadness
I'm trying the best I can.,6,6,sadness
"I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.",6,6,sadness

"Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",6,6,sadness
"I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.",6,5,neutral
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.",6,1,joy
"Oh, well look what we've got here.",6,7,disgust
"Well, it isn't champagne.",6,6,sadness
Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?,5,0,surprise

"Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.",6,3,anger
The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.,6,6,sadness
"Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.",6,7,disgust

You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.,6,3,anger
I am not the slightest bit drunk.,6,7,disgust
I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,6,5,neutral
